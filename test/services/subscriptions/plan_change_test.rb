# When a plan change takes effect, and what the processor is told to do about
# the money in between.
#
# The rule, in one sentence: **a move to a more expensive plan takes effect
# immediately, a move to a cheaper or equal one takes effect at the end of the
# current period.** It is one rule rather than two because the two directions
# are the same decision read from opposite ends, and stating them separately
# invites them to disagree.
#
# Why this rule and not the other one:
#
#   * **An upgrade charges the difference now.** The customer asked for more
#     service, and getting it at the end of the period means they used it for
#     free in the meantime. The credit for the time already paid on the old plan
#     is the processor's to compute — this object never multiplies a price by a
#     fraction of a month.
#   * **A downgrade does not refund mid-period.** Nobody is refunded for a plan
#     they are already leaving, and a customer who downgrades to a cheaper plan
#     is not billed for the remainder at the new rate before the period ends.
#     Charging the difference downwards would mean issuing a credit, and a credit
#     this service computed would be a number that eventually disagreed with the
#     processor's own books.
#
# Both directions are one comparison of two `Money` values, which is the only
# arithmetic in this file and it is a comparison, not a calculation. Nothing
# here is a Float and nothing here is ever persisted.
#
# Two comparisons are refused rather than guessed:
#
#   * **Different currencies.** `Money#<=>` returns nil across currencies, and
#     Comparable would raise from an `>`. That is the right answer — FX is a
#     pricing decision, not something a plan change may make — but the refusal
#     has to be a named, tested outcome rather than an exception from a
#     comparison operator.
#   * **Different intervals.** Ten dollars a month against a hundred a year is
#     not a cheaper plan; it is a different product with a different unit. A
#     monthly price multiplied by twelve is an *annualised* figure and deciding
#     a billing change from one would be computing money that is not asked for.
