# The lifecycle: the one place a subscription's state changes.
#
# Everything about a subscription is decided by the processor, so this is where a
# verified webhook becomes a row, and where the row and the event are written in
# one transaction. Four properties are asserted here, and they are the packet:
#
#   * **A start creates exactly one row, and it is live.** Nothing is born
#     canceled.
#   * **A replay changes nothing.** The same event twice, and the same state twice
#     under two different event ids, both leave the row and the outbox identical.
#   * **An illegal transition is refused and recorded, not applied.** A canceled
#     subscription is never revived, whatever arrives and in whatever order.
#   * **An out-of-order delivery cannot corrupt state.** A deletion that arrives
#     before its creation, and an update that arrives before its creation, are
#     both handled rather than papered over.
#
# The events are written in the same transaction as the row, so a delivery that
# dies mid-way leaves neither. That is asserted here by rolling the transaction
# back at the emission, and the row is checked to be gone with it.

  #
  # The rule this service guarantees about a *sequence* of deliveries, as opposed

  # the one case where this service knows the order for certain: a deletion that
  # overtook its own creation. Every other pair of statuses is legal, and legal is
  # not the same as current.
  #
  # So the row records the processor's own timestamp for the delivery that last
  # wrote it — `last_processor_event_at`, written in the same statement as the
  # state so the two cannot disagree — and a delivery that *predates* it is
  # refused. Without that, a `customer.subscription.updated` the processor retried
  # an hour late lands on a row it has already moved past, and the row moves back:
  # a `past_due` subscription whose charge failed becomes `active` again, which
  # grants entitlements for a subscription nobody is paying for. That is the one
  # outcome the lifecycle exists to make impossible, and `last_processor_event_at`
  # was added to prevent it and never consulted.
  #
  # **Strictly older.** A delivery carrying the *same* processor timestamp is not
  # stale: the processor's timestamps are epoch seconds, so two genuinely
  # different events routinely share one and refusing those would drop real
  # deliveries. With no ordering information between them, last-write-wins is the
