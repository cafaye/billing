# The only place this service talks *to* Stripe.
#
# Two things this seam is for, and they are different:
#
#   * **It is the whole of the outbound surface.** Every Stripe call in this
#     repository is one of these three methods. That is what makes "this service
#     only receives from Stripe" a claim about the code rather than an intention:
#     there is no `Stripe::` call anywhere else to find.
#   * **It is the seam the specs replace.** A checkout URL and a subscription's
#     existence both come from Stripe, so a test cannot invent them and assert
#     the invention. The specs record what was *asked* of Stripe and assert on the
#     request; the response is a fixture of the processor's, not of this service's
#     design.
#
# What the client deliberately does **not** do is compute anything about money.
# `apply_plan_change` sends a `proration_behavior`; the amount that behaviour
# produces is Stripe's. `create_checkout_session` sends a price id.
# `cancel_subscription` sends an id and a boolean. A figure calculated in Ruby and
# sent to Stripe would be a figure that eventually disagreed with the processor's
# ledger, and the disagreement would surface in a customer's invoice.
