# The allowlist is asserted on directly in `AllowlistTest`; this file is the other
# half, and it is the half that cannot be satisfied by a correct list. A service
# whose `ALLOWED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTES` is perfect and whose middleware records the
# concrete request path, the query string and the headers passes every allowlist
# assertion there is and leaks on every request. So these are integration tests:
# they drive requests through the whole stack and read what actually came out.
#
# The presence assertion is in every one of them, through `TestSpans.rendered!`,
# which RAISES on an empty export. Every absence assertion here is therefore also a
# presence one — see `TestSpanExporter` for the three exporter-contract bugs that
# made that necessary.
