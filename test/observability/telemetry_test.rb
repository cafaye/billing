# These are the claims that are cheap to state and expensive to lose: which
# endpoint billing exports to, what the resource says, that the route table is the
# ROUTER's own, that a root span is sampled, and that the whole thing installed at
# all. Each of them has a failure mode where the service looks configured and
# exports nothing, which is why `TestSpans.rendered!` raises on an empty export
# rather than returning "" — three separate exporter-contract bugs did exactly
# that while this repository's telemetry was being written.
