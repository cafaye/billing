# The HTTP contract and the router, held to each other by method *and* path.
#
# `openapi/v1.yaml` is what a client is generated from and `config/routes.rb` is
# what answers. Two ways they can disagree, and neither is a small one for a
# service that handles money: an operation the document declares and the service
# does not serve is a call a generated client makes against a 404, and an
# operation the service serves and no document declares is reachable by nobody
# who wrote a client — an endpoint nobody chose, described nowhere.
#
# The check this replaces compared **paths only**, so it could not see this:
#
#     resources :customers, only: %i[index create show update]
#
# draws `PATCH /v1/customers/:id` and `PUT /v1/customers/:id`, and only the first
# was in the document. One path on each side, and the comparison reported
# agreement. Keying on `(method, path)` is what sees it.
#
# It lives here rather than in `test/contract/outbox_envelope_contract_test.rb`
# because that spec skips when `core` is not on disk, and a check that hides
# behind a skip is not a check. This one reads three files this repository owns —
# the document, the manifest and the route set — so it runs wherever the suite
# runs, with or without `core` beside it.

  # one is keyed under each of these rather than under a verb that is not a
