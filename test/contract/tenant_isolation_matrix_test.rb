# Every account-scoped route, enumerated, with what the router actually serves.
#
# ## Why this file existed when the answer was "none of them are scoped"
#
# The question a multi-tenant billing service has to answer is *can an
# authenticated caller reach another account's subscription, invoice or payment
# method?* billing-12 could not answer it, because there was no authenticated
# caller: `/v1` read no token, since core says identity is the only issuer and the
# JWKS verification was not in this repository. `GET /v1/subscriptions` returned
# every row and `POST /v1/subscriptions/{id}/cancel` cancelled whichever row the
# path named.
#
# So billing-12 made the gap **total**: it enumerated the routes the router serves
# and required every one to be classified here with a reason, so a route added
# tomorrow fails by name the day it is added rather than the day somebody notices
# reading the diff. **billing-21 answered the question and kept the enumeration.**
#
# ## What changed in billing-21, and what did not
#
# **Ten of the fourteen entries flipped from `unscoped` to `scoped`** — the four
# customer reads/writes and all six subscription operations, which now resolve
# inside `Customer.for_account` / `Subscription.for_account`. The four assertions
# that held the word `unscoped` in place are **inverted**, not deleted: they now
# assert the verdicts are exactly what the code does, so the day someone removes a
# scope this file fails naming the route. A matrix whose verdict can only be
# "unscoped" is a matrix that stops being a check on the day it is fixed.
#
# **The four plan rows did not flip, and that is the finding.** A plan is platform
# catalogue — what an account may buy, not what an account owns — so it carries no
# `account_id` column and there is nothing to scope it by. `test/support/two_accounts.rb`
# shares one plan between both accounts precisely because that is true, and
# `subscriptions_live_account_plan_idx` is keyed on `(account_id, plan_id)` for the
# same reason. The four are asserted as `CATALOGUE` — a third verdict, for a route
# that is neither account-scoped nor unscoped but shared — rather than being filed
# under `unscoped` with a paragraph explaining it, which is how a shared resource
# becomes an unnoticed gap.
#
# ## What this is not
#
# It is not an authorization check, and it does not become one by being strict
# about prose. It is a **verdict table**, and a verdict that stops matching the
# code is a red test naming a route — which is the outcome worth having.
#
# It lives here rather than in `outbox_envelope_contract_test.rb` because that
# file skips when `core` is not on disk, and a check that hides behind a skip is
# not a check. This one reads the router, which is always there.
class TenantIsolationMatrixTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # The three verdicts a `/v1` route can carry here, and all three are
  # **load-bearing words**: they are what makes "this route reads another tenant's
  # data", "this route reads only the caller's" and "this route is shared platform
  # data" distinguishable at a glance, so a route cannot quietly move between
  # tables by being reclassified without someone reading why.

  # Not tenant data. A plan is what an account may buy, not what an account owns,
  # so it has no `account_id` and every account reads the same rows. Added in
  # billing-21 because filing these four under `unscoped` — which they were —
  # described a shared catalogue as a defect, and a table that calls the model
  # broken is a table nobody reads.

  # service"; the matrix is about the code in this worktree.

  # written in the router's spelling.
  #
  # The obvious choice was to normalize into the document's `{id}`, which is what
  # `HttpSurfaceContractTest` does because it compares against `openapi/v1.yaml`.
  # This matrix has no document: it compares a table against the router, so the
  # router defines the alphabet and the table is written in it.
  #
  # Normalizing *both* sides into a third spelling would have been a worse guard,
  # not a better one: a table whose keys were wrong in the same way a route was
  # wrong would then agree with it, and this file would report agreement about an
  # operation no client can call. One side normalized to a spelling the other side
  # does not use is what makes a disagreement visible instead of silent.

  # (`:id`, `:slug`) so both sides are read in one alphabet.
  #
  # The reason is not decoration. `TENANT_DATA` names the two columns that decide
  # whether a route belongs here, so the classification is derived from a fact
  # about the model rather than asserted about a path — and a route that starts

  #
  # **Keys are read in the router's spelling.** Rails draws `:id` and `:slug`; the
  # OpenAPI document writes `{id}` and `{slug}`. Normalising the way
  # `HttpSurfaceContractTest` does is what caught this: the table was first
  # written in the document's spelling, and the two directions then reported all
  # eight parameterised routes as unclassified *and* all eight as stale at once.
  # That double failure is what a normalizing test can produce and a
