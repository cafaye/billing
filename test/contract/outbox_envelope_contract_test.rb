#
# It reads core's real schema rather than restating it, so a change in core is
# caught here instead of being discovered by a consumer's SDK. When core is not
# on disk — a standalone service checkout, where `core` is a different

  # so the row is an action item there, not something this worktree can land.
  # See the DECISION NEEDED in cafaye.yml. This list is the mechanical half of
  # that obligation: core's own suite only checks core's example manifests, and
  # `caf contract lint` does not exist yet, so without this a new event type
  # published here with no catalog row would pass every suite in the system.

  # Events whose `data` does not satisfy the payload schema core declares for
  # them, and exactly how it differs. **Empty in billing-04. Five entries in
  # billing-05, every one of them opened by core-03 rather than by anything in
  # this repository.**
  #
  # billing-04 closed this table against core v0.2, which shipped two payload
  # schemas. core-03 shipped all eight, and five of them describe a payload this
  # build does not emit:
  #
  #   * `billing.plan.created` and `billing.plan.updated` are closed with
  #     `additionalProperties: false` and do not name `entitlements`, which
  #     billing-04 added to `Plan#as_json`.
  #   * `billing.subscription.started`, `.updated` and `.canceled` are core's
  #     *processor-normalised* shape — the one billing-03b emitted — while
  #     billing-04 moved the three subscription events onto billing's own ids:
  #     `subscription_id` is `Subscription#id`, which is also the envelope's
  #     `subject`, with `plan_id`, `account_id`, `currency`, `started_at` and
  #     `processor_subscription_id` around it and no `kind`.
  #
  # The second one is a spec question, not a bug in a payload, and it is recorded
  # rather than paid for. core's D10 gives the reason the schema was rewritten as
  # "billing has no subscriptions table and cannot invent ids it does not have" —
  # true of billing-03b, which is what core-03 read, and not true of billing-04,
  # which added one. core's own D10 anticipates precisely this: "when billing
  # grows a subscriptions table, the shape moves again … that is a second breaking
  # change." That second breaking change is core's to make, core is read-only from
  # a service worktree, and the two ways to make the test green without it — emit a
  # payload nobody has agreed to, or drop the ids a consumer needs — are both the
  # spec changing without a decision. So the difference is written down here and
  # in `cafaye.yml`, and asked of the manager.
  #
  # `entitlements` is the same shape of problem at smaller scale: core's plan
  # schema is missing a field this publisher has always sent. Removing it from the
  # payload is a contract change this worktree does not get to make, and the plan
  # payload is the same shape an HTTP response uses, so it cannot be quietly
  # narrowed here either.
  #
  # Asserted as a set rather than subtracted from the failures. Subtracting would
  # let a payload that starts matching sit here forever, and would let a new event
  # stop matching without anyone noticing. A set means a difference in either

  # The one entry this table held was `billing.subscription.started` with three
  # fields, and core-03 settles each of the three on its own. D10 rewrote
  # `schemas/events/billing/subscription/started.schema.json`:
  #
  #   * `subscription_id` — core still declares the property, but as
  #     `{"type": "string", "minLength": 1}` with **no `pattern`**. The
  #     `^sub_[0-9A-Z]{26}$` this entry recorded is gone, so there is nothing left
  #     for a uuid to fail to match.
  #   * `plan_id` — core's schema does not declare the property at all. A field
  #     core does not name cannot constrain an id.
  #   * `account_id` — the same, for the same reason.
  #
  # The mechanism this table exists for is *removal*: an entry is meant to go when

  # core's files and the payloads this build emits, and compares. It cannot pass
  # vacuously, because the work it does is over core's schemas, not over this
  # constant. The corpus and the grammar comparison move with it, onto the two
