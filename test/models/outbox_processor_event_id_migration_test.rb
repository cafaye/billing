# `IndexOutboxEventsOnProcessorEventId` is reversible, and this is the test that
# takes it both ways.
#
# ## Why it is not in `outbox_event_test.rb`
#
# Because running a migration **commits the enclosing transaction**. A migration
# wraps its work in its own `ddl_transaction`, so the `down` here ends the
# test's transaction and every row the test had written becomes durably
# committed — which is how a first version of this, run inside
# `outbox_event_test.rb`, left an outbox row behind and made the *next* test
# fail on a count one too high. Four unrelated failures, none of which was about
# this test.
#
# The separation is the safety property, not a matter of taste. This is the only
# file in the repository that turns transactional tests off for that reason, and
# it is also the only one that *has* to: a constraint test that asserts an index
# exists is a comment, and one that runs the migration backwards is a test.
#
# ## What "reversible" has to mean here
#
# Not that the migration has no `up` method. `change` rolling back to
# `remove_index` is a claim about Rails, and this is the assertion that the claim
# holds **against this database**: the index goes, the duplicate the index exists
# to prevent becomes writable again, and the index comes back and refuses it
# once more. The middle step matters most — it is what shows the constraint is
# what was doing the refusing, rather than a validation on the model.
class OutboxProcessorEventIdMigrationTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # Required, not autoloaded: the test runs the migration's own `change` in both
  # directions, so the class has to exist.

    # through leaves the index down.
