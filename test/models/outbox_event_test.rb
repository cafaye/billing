    #
    # `requires_new: true` is the whole point. A uniqueness violation aborts the
    # enclosing PostgreSQL transaction, so every later command on that connection
    # fails with `PG::InFailedSqlTransaction` — a state no amount of rescuing
    # recovers from, and exactly what an earlier version of this test hit.
    # Rolling back to a savepoint clears the abort, so the rest of the suite is
    # unaffected. PostgreSQL's DDL is transactional as well, which is why
    # dropping and recreating the index inside here leaves nothing behind.
    #
    # The `raise ActiveRecord::Rollback` is **inside** the `transaction` block,
    # which is the only place it means "roll back this savepoint and return
    # normally". Raising it from the method body instead — the shape this helper
    # had first — propagates to the test's own wrapping transaction, which
    # swallows it and discards the test's data, and the *next* test then fails on
    # a count one too high. A helper that corrupts the tests after it is worse
    # than no helper.
    #
    # **Only `ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid` is swallowed**, and that is
    # deliberate: `RecordNotUnique` descends from it, and it is the only thing
    # this helper is here to absorb. A `Minitest::Assertion` is re-raised, so a
    # failing assertion inside the block is still reported as a failure instead
    # of being converted into a return value and lost — a helper that swallows
    # its own test failures is the "silent green" this repository has refused
