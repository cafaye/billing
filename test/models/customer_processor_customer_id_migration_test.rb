# `IndexCustomersOnProcessorCustomerId` is reversible, and this is the test that
# takes it both ways.
#
# ## Why it is a file of its own
#
# Because running a migration **commits the enclosing transaction**. A migration
# wraps its work in its own `ddl_transaction`, so the `down` here ends the test's
# transaction and every row it had written becomes durably committed — which is
# how the first version of this, run inside `outbox_event_test.rb`, left an outbox
# row behind and made the *next* test fail on a count one too high. This is the
# safety property, not a matter of taste: a constraint test that asserts an index
# exists is a comment, and one that runs the migration backwards is a test.
#
# ## What "reversible" has to mean here
#
# Not that the migration has no `up` method. `change` rolling back to
# `remove_index` is a claim about Rails, and this is the assertion that the claim
# holds **against this database**: the index goes, the duplicate the index exists
# to prevent becomes writable again, and the index comes back and refuses it once
# more. The middle step is the one that matters — it is what shows the *index* is
# what was doing the refusing.
#
# ## The model is kept out of it on purpose
#
# `Customer` carries a matching uniqueness **validation**, so a test that wrote
# the duplicate through `Customer.create!` would be refused by the validation and
# would never reach the index — proving nothing about the constraint, and passing
# on a build where the migration had been rolled back. Every duplicate below is
# written with `insert_all!`, which goes straight to the database and skips
# validations and callbacks, so what is being measured is the table's opinion and
# not the model's.

    # what happened the first time it was written, and it is the same refusal a
    # deployment hits on a table that already holds the defect.

    # The index is the suite's invariant, and a failed assertion partway through
    # leaves it down — so the next **file** would measure a table this service does
    # not have. The teardown's job is "do not leave a mess"; the setup's is "never
    # trust what the last test left", and both are needed. See the setup comment for
