# A plan's entitlements: what buying it grants.
#
# The column is new in billing-04 and it is a *public* field — it comes back on
# every plan and on `GET /v1/subscriptions/:id/entitlements`, which is what
# `guard` and any other consumer will gate a feature on. A shape this loose would
# let `features: "dashboards"` through, and `Array("dashboards")` renders it as
# `["dashboards"]` — a string that happens to be the right one, on a field where
# somebody will eventually write `features.first.end_with?`.
#
# So the shape is closed here, at the only place a plan is written, rather than
# guessed at by each reader.
