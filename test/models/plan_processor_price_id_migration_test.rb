# `IndexPlansOnProcessorPriceId` is reversible, and this is the test that takes it
# both ways.
#
# The shape is the one `CustomerProcessorCustomerIdMigrationTest` uses, and it is
# the one `outbox_processor_event_id_migration_test.rb` established: the file is
# separate because running a migration commits the enclosing transaction, and the
# middle step of the reversibility claim — the index down, the duplicate writable,
# the index back, the duplicate refused — is the only part that shows the index is
# what was doing the refusing.
#
# ## The model is kept out of it on purpose
#
# `Plan` carries a matching uniqueness **validation**, so a duplicate written
# through `Plan.create!` would be refused by the validation and never reach the
# index. Every row here is written with `insert_all!`, which goes straight to the
# database, so what is measured is the table's opinion.
#
# ## Why this one has a shape the customers test does not
#
# A collision on `processor_price_id` is a **pricing** defect, not only a lookup
# hazard: the two plans below charge different amounts, and a subscription billed
# against whichever one claimed the id is billed at a price this service never
# agreed to with the customer. So the rows are built with two prices on purpose,
# and one test asserts they still differ after the round trip — otherwise a
# collision here would be indistinguishable from a cosmetic one and the test
# would be asserting less than it looks like.

  # test too. The predicate is asserted in `db/schema.rb` and argued in the
  # migration; the behaviour that would actually break is a `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`
  # column or an array-backed unique constraint, and this is what catches those.
