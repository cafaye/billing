# What must never appear in a log line, an exception message or a rendered page.
#
# ## Why this is a test and not a linter
#
# The fleet measured this: **no off-the-shelf static analyser finds a secret
# leaked at runtime.** Zero of 268 Semgrep rules intersect CWE-532, gosec has no
# `*ast.CallExpr` case, and Bandit is `ast.Constant`-only. Every one of those
# tools finds a *constant* that looks like a credential, which is not the same
# question at all — the leak is `Rails.logger.error("... #{exception.message}")`
# where the message was built three frames up from something the processor sent.
#
# So it cannot be delegated. It has to be pinned by a test that **captures real log
# output and asserts the secret is absent**, and that renders the failure path
# rather than the happy one, because the failure path is where leaks live: nobody
# logs the value on the way in, everybody logs the exception on the way out.
#
# ## Why the secret is fake
#
# Every value below is a literal in this file that is a credential for nothing:
# `sk_test_…` is the shape, and the suffix is the word `not_a_real_key`. A real
# key in a fixture is a real key in version control, and a real key in a CI log is
# a real key in a retained, searchable, often-public place. The shape is what the
# assertions are about — whether this service can be made to *print* one.

  #    the processor echoed back in that error — to land in a log line.
  #
