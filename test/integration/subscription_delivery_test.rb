# The two properties this packet exists for, isolated from everything else.
#
# ## Replay
#
# Stripe retries on any non-2xx and promises nothing about ordering, so a delivery
# arriving twice is ordinary operation, not a bug. The cost of getting it wrong is
# a second envelope id for one fact, which a consumer deduplicating on that id
# cannot tell from new information.
#
# This is a *sweep*: the whole lifecycle, and at each step the event delivered a
# second time with the subscription, the outbox and the delivery row compared
# attribute for attribute afterwards. The per-fixture cases in
# test/services/subscriptions/lifecycle_test.rb are there to explain why; this one
# is here so that adding a fourth subscription event without a replay case is a
# failure rather than an omission nobody notices.
#
# ## The hand-off to courier
#
# Nothing here sends an email and nothing here calls courier. A transactional
# "your subscription started" is an event, and the outbox is how it gets there —
# which is the only arrangement that survives the publisher loop this repository
# does not have yet. These specs hold that the two events courier needs are
# published, declared, catalogued, and published *in the same transaction* as the
# state change that means there is something to send.
class SubscriptionDeliveryTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase

  # for the third and the fourth; the sweep walks the list and re-delivers each
  # entry in the state the walk has built up.

  # `core`'s catalog is read from a path derived from the checkout's own

  # repositories side by side and **errored on a CI runner**, which has one
  # checkout and no sibling:
  #
  #   Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen -
  #     <parent-of-checkout>/core/docs/event-naming.md
  #
  # The hardcoded path was the defect, not the failure. `outbox_envelope_
  # contract_test.rb` has read core through `CORE_PATH` since billing-02 and
  # falls back to the sibling directory for exactly this reason, so the seam
  # already existed and this file simply was not using it — which is how a
  # repository ends up with one core-reading tier that CI can run and another
  # that CI can only crash on.
  #
  # The skip is deliberate and narrow, and it is the shape PLAN §1 asks for: the
  # condition is stated in the test rather than implied by a missing file, and
  # CI sets `CORE_PATH` and **fails the build on any skipped test at all**, so
  # this line cannot be reached green in CI.

    # test here. The event's own `time` is the processor's timestamp and is
    # unaffected, which is the point of it being the processor's.
    # The delivery's id travels **in** the body, because that is how it arrives:
    # `stripe_controller.rb` hands `Ingestion` `event_id: payload["id"]` and merges
    # the verified event's id over whatever the body claimed, so a delivery and the
    # payload that arrived with it can never disagree about which event this is.
    #
    # A helper that varied the delivery's id while leaving the body's id at the
    # fixture's was arranging a state Stripe never sends — and it **changed which
    # refusal fired**: `Subscriptions::Lifecycle`'s stale check compares the
    # processor's own `created` timestamp, so a re-delivery of the *same* fixture
    # under a new id was arriving with the same timestamp as the row's, and the
    # stale rule did not fire while `no_change_to_record` did. Once the id is moved
