# The HTTP edge. What a processor sees is the whole contract, and the rules it
# has to hold to are narrow:
#
#   * a valid signature is 200 — including a replay, an unknown type, a type we
#     deliberately ignore, and an event whose processing failed. Anything else
#     teaches the processor to retry something that will never succeed.
#   * a bad signature is 400 and stores nothing at all, because an unverified
#     body is not an event.
#   * a missing signing secret is our misconfiguration, not the sender's fault,
#     and must never be mistaken for a bad signature.
#
# The error bodies are the same `application/problem+json` every other non-2xx in
# this service is, from the same one place — asserted with the shared
# `assert_problem` helper rather than field by field.
