# Two literals that have to agree, asserted rather than left to a comment.
#
# ## Which two
#
# `StripeSubscriptionFixtures::PROCESSOR_PRICE_ID` (and its `ADDITIONAL_PRICE_IDS`)
# is what a plan is given when a spec asks for a plan, and `FakeStripeAPI::KNOWN_PRICES`
# is what the fake processor has heard of. **A plan whose price the fake has never
# heard of is a plan the processor turns down** — that refusal is deliberate, and it
# is what makes "the processor said no" a thing the specs can arrange. So a spec
# that puts a second plan on sale has to be given a price the fake knows, and a
# spec that is not would silently be asserting a processor refusal where it meant a
# successful one.
#
# That is a real coupling, and it is a **copy** rather than a reference: the fake
# loads before the fixtures module (`test_helper.rb` requires
# `test/support/**/*.rb` in sorted order, and `fake_stripe_api` sorts first), so
# `KNOWN_PRICES` cannot read the constant at class-body time. The alternative — a
# pattern match, or the fake learning prices on demand — would let the fake accept
# anything, which is the property the refusal tests depend on.
#
# So the two are separate lists and this file is what holds them in step. Its whole
# reason to exist is that the disagreement is invisible: nothing raises, nothing
# fails, and a spec quietly tests the wrong thing.
#
# ## Why `price_new` is in there and not generated
#
# `test/services/processor/stripe_client_test.rb` names `price_new` directly, so it
# has to stay a member of the list. It is a price no fixture helper hands out, which
# is exactly what a test wants when it is naming a second plan's price itself.
class FixtureProcessorIdsTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # The regression test for the change billing-13 made to these helpers, and the
  # reason it is behavioural rather than a shape check.
  #
  # Both helpers used to default to a single constant, so a spec that asked for a
  # second customer or a second plan got **two rows claiming one `cus_`/`price_`** —
  # which was invisible until `customers_processor_customer_id_idx` and
  # `plans_processor_price_id_idx` made it a unique violation, and then it took 85
  # tests in `test/requests/v1/subscriptions_test.rb` down at once. A test about the
  # *shape* of the id lists would not have caught it: the bug was never the list,
  # it was the default.
