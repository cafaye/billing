# The inventory of money paths, which is what keeps the coverage gate honest over
# time.
#
# `test/coverage/money_paths_coverage_test.rb` measures a *list* of files. A list
# that is never checked against the repository is a list that quietly stops
# covering code added after it: the new money path goes ungated and the gate stays
# green, which is the failure mode a coverage gate exists to prevent.
#
# So this file partitions every file that touches money into exactly two groups,
# and asserts the partition is complete:
#
#   * **A money path** — the file exists to be about amounts, and is held to 100%
#     line and branch coverage. `app/models/money.rb` and
#     `Subscriptions::PlanChange` are the two.
#   * **A file with money in it** — it builds, parses or reads an amount as one
#     part of a larger job, and is not line-gated. The amount is still reached
#     and still checked; that is asserted at the bottom of this file, because
#     "not in the gate's list" must never quietly come to mean "not covered".
#
# The second group carries its reason in `MIXED_MONEY_FILES`, and the reason is
# asserted to still apply, so an entry cannot rot into a claim nothing checks.
