# The coverage gate for the money paths, per PLAN §3: 100% line *and* branch
# coverage, measured with Ruby's standard library `Coverage` so the gate costs no
# gem.
#
# The measurement runs in a subprocess. That is not incidental: `Coverage` records
# only what executes after it is started, so measuring inside the minitest
# process would report a file as covered when it had merely already been
# autoloaded — a gate that passes for the wrong reason. `MoneyCoverage` runs a
# fresh process that loads the files itself; see test/support/money_coverage.rb.
#
# The corpus is shared rather than duplicated: the probe loads
# test/support/money_coverage_exercise.rb, whose every case is also asserted for
# behaviour in test/models/money_test.rb and
# test/services/subscriptions/plan_change_test.rb. A case added to cover a new
# branch is therefore a case those specs also run, and there is no second list of
# cases to forget.
class MoneyPathsCoverageTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # The money paths. `money.rb` is the primitive and has been gated since
  # billing-01; `plan_change.rb` is the only place in billing-04 that compares
  # two amounts, and therefore the only place this packet could make a decision
  # on money.
  #
  # A file joins this list when it can produce or compare an amount. The
  # inventory test in this directory asserts the list against the repository, so a
  # new money path added without adding it here fails rather than going ungated.
