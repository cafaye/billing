# Cross-account isolation, behaviourally, against Postgres.
#
# ## The property every test here asserts
#
# > **An account A operation reaches nothing belonging to account B, and gets the
# > same answer as it would for something that does not exist.**
#
# ## Why these live here and not on the HTTP surface
#
# Because `/v1` has no caller to be account A. There is no token, so there is no
# account to compare against, and a wire-level "account A asks for account B's
# resource" cannot be written — there is no A to send. That gap is the recorded
# one in `contract/tenant_isolation_matrix_test.rb` and in each controller's own
# header, and nothing here pretends to close it or to paper over it.
#
# What *is* available is better than a wire test, because it is closer to the
# money: the account boundary in this service is **a fact in the data**, carried
# by `Subscription#account_id` and `Customer#owner_id`, and it is enforced in
# three places. All three are exercised below with two real accounts, and the
# fourth operation kind — delete — is asserted to have nothing to act on.
#
# This is the same split darkroom-09 used, and for the same reason: *is the
# scoping still written down* is a property of the source and *does the scoping
# actually hold* is a property of Postgres. Neither substitutes for the other,
# which is why there is a structural file beside this one.
#
# ## Two things that make a test here useless, and are therefore avoided
#
#   * **Asserting only that a lookup returned nil.** A cross-tenant write that
#     missed its scoping and then lost a second race on some other constraint
#     also returns nothing. So every cross-account assertion here says what
#     *survived*, not only what was refused.
#   * **Printing the other account's row.** A failure that dumps account B's
#     price and status into CI output is a leak the spec created. Every
#     comparison goes through `TwoAccounts#fingerprint`, a digest, so a failure
#     names *which* ids moved and nothing about what they held.
