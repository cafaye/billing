# Every account-scoped entry point in this service, enumerated and **derived**.
#
# ## Why this file exists beside `contract/tenant_isolation_matrix_test.rb`
#
# That file answers one question about the routes: is this operation
# account-scoped, and is its scope recorded. It does not answer the three this
# file answers, and the rest of the packet is built on all three:
#
#   * **how many** account-scoped entry points there are — not only on the HTTP
#     surface but in the controllers, models and services underneath it;
#   * **what kind** of access each one performs, so "read, list, update, delete"
#     is a count a reader can check rather than a sentence in a report; and
#   * **that the set is total** — a data access nobody classified is an entry
#     point whose scope nobody decided, and it is live on the next deploy.
#
# A negative test is written per entry point, and that count only means
# something if the number of entry points is itself pinned. So the tables below
# are compared against the source in **both directions**: an unclassified data
# access fails here by name, and a classified entry point whose method has gone
# away fails the other way. Neither failure is silent, which is the whole reason
# the tables are derived rather than maintained.
#
# ## Two layers, two numbers, and why they are not added together
#
# A **route** is a caller-facing operation on the HTTP surface: 14 of them. A
# **data access** is one place in `app/` that reads or writes a tenant's row:
# 35 of them, in 33 methods. The two layers overlap — a route is served by a
# controller method that performs a data access — and they are counted separately
# on purpose. Adding them would produce one larger number that means nothing,
# and the two answer different questions: the route count is "how much of the
# surface is a caller's to reach", the data-access count is "how many places hold
# a tenant's row".
#
# billing-12 wrote this when the second number was a to-do list — "how many places
# have to be scoped when identity's JWKS verification lands" — and billing-21 landed
# it. The two account scopes are in the count, the five `/v1` customer and
# subscription reads now go through them, and nothing was removed.
#
# ## Why the derivation is per-method and not per-line
#
# The obvious key is `file:line`, and it is the wrong one: inserting a comment
# renumbers every site below it and turns a documentation edit into a red suite.
# The key is **`path` plus the method the access sits in**, which is the unit a
# reader thinks in — "the `show` action of `V1::CustomersController` reads any
# customer by its uuid" — and which survives the edits that actually happen.
#
# **The kind is part of the key**, because one method can do two kinds of thing
# and `Subscriptions::Lifecycle#apply` does exactly that: it builds a row that did
# not exist and writes to the one that did. A key of `(path, method)` alone would
# force a choice between them and report a smaller number than the code has.
#
# ## What "account-scoped" means here
#
# A data access is account-scoped when it reads or writes a row that belongs to an
# account. Two columns decide it: `Subscription#account_id`, and `Customer#owner_id`
# when the owner is an `Account`. `Plan` is in the set because it is the catalogue
# every account buys from, and because the contract matrix already treats it as
# tenant data — the same three models, re-pinned here so neither file drifts alone.
#
# Nine of the 35 are **declarations** rather than executed resolutions: the two
# `belongs_to` on `Subscription`, the seven `scope`s on `Subscription`, `Customer`
# and `OutboxEvent`. They are counted, because an association and a scope are both
# queries and leaving a category out of an enumeration is how the enumeration stops
# being one — but they are counted as declarations, so a reader who wants only the
# places a request actually reaches a row has **26** and not 35.
#
# A declaration is counted only when the class declaring it holds tenant data:
# `Customer`, `Plan`, `Subscription` (an `account_id` column) or `OutboxEvent` (an
# `account_id` inside `data`). `IdempotencyKey` has a `scope :expired` and is not
# in either set, because it is keyed on the request's own idempotency key and
# touches no tenant row.
#
# `OutboxEvent` is **not** in the tenant-data set and is counted as writes instead,
# for a reason worth stating: an outbox row has no `account_id` of its own. It
# carries one inside `data`, and only because a writer put it there. Nothing in
# this repository reads an outbox row back by account — the publisher loop does
# not exist yet — so the brief's "outbox events" are three writes and zero reads
# here, and that is asserted rather than left to a reader's imagination.
class TenantAccountEntryPointMatrixTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # The kinds an access can have. `delete` is in the vocabulary and its count is
  # asserted to be **zero**, because the alternative — leaving it out of the list
  # — is how "a service that deletes nothing" and "a service that forgot to scope
  # its deletes" come to read the same in a report.

  # The models whose rows **carry** an account without having an account column.
  #
  # `OutboxEvent` is the only one, and the distinction is worth stating rather
  # than smoothing over. An outbox row's `account_id` lives inside `data`, and only
  # because a writer put it there; the table has no `account_id` of its own, so
  # there is nothing for a query to constrain on even today. That is exactly why
  # the outbox answers the brief's "or outbox events" with **three writes and no
  # read by account** — and its three declared scopes are counted here, because a
  # scope over rows that hold every account's events is still a query over tenant
  # data even when the column to scope it by does not exist yet.

  # Every `/v1` operation the router serves, keyed by `[method, router path]`,
  # with the kind of access it performs and why it is account-scoped.
  #
  # Keyed in the **router's spelling** (`:id`, `:slug`), the same choice
  # `contract/tenant_isolation_matrix_test.rb` makes and for the same reason: a
  # table written in the OpenAPI document's spelling (`{id}`) and compared against
  # the router would report every parameterised route as both unclassified and
  # stale at once, and a reader could not tell which half was wrong.
  #
  # **billing-21 made the first and last groups scoped**, and the value says so
  # rather than leaving a reader to grep for `for_account`: every customer and
  # subscription read is now `Customer.for_account(token.account_id)` or
  # `Subscription.for_account(token.account_id)`, and a uuid naming another account's
  # row is a 404. See `test/authentication/` for the refusals and
  # `test/tenant/cross_account_web_test.rb` for the rewritten characterisations.
  #
  # **The four plan rows are the exception and say why**: a plan is platform
  # catalogue — what an account may buy, not what an account owns — so it carries no
  # account and the routes resolve it by slug or uuid with no filter. That is the
  # model, not a gap; `test/support/two_accounts.rb` shares one plan between both

  #
  # `assign_attributes` is in the list because it is a write to a row that already
  # exists and nothing else in it says so: a `find` followed by a `save` is two
  # accesses, and only one of them is a resolution.
  #
  # `scope.where` is `CursorPaging#apply_cursor` and nothing else in the
  # repository, written out rather than matched as a bare `where` because a bare
  # `where` would also match a hash condition on a model scope, which is not a
  # separate entry point — it is a predicate on one already listed.
  #
  # `belongs_to` is counted as a **declared** join. The two in `Subscription` are
  # the only ones, and the method name is the whole declaration because a
  # `belongs_to` is not inside a `def`.
  #
  # `scope` is counted for the same reason, and is the shape account scoping is
  # most likely to arrive in — `scope :for_account, ->(id) { where(account_id: id) }`
  # — so a scope nobody classified has to fail here rather than becoming the first
  # account-scoped query in the service with no entry point and no negative test.
  #
  # Matched on the **declaration** rather than on the body, and that is not a
  # simplification. `scope :oldest_first, -> { order(:created_at, :id) }` has no
  # `where` in it at all, and `scope :for_processor_event` puts its `where` on the
  # line *after* the arrow — so a pattern looking for a body would find two of the
  # five and miss both, in the same way, on the same line. Every scope returns a
  # relation and every relation is a collection read, so `list` is the correct kind

  # — and a matrix whose count falls when the boundary lands is a matrix that stops

  #

      "account-scoped: add it to DATA_ACCESSES with its kind and what it touches, or " \
      "name the file in NO_DATA_ACCESS with the reason it is not."
  end

  # The other direction, and the one that keeps the table from rotting. A row for
  # a method that has gone away excludes nothing today and will exclude whatever
  # is added at that method next, which is why a stale row fails.
  test "every entry point this matrix classifies is one the source still has" do
    assert_empty classified_sites - self.class.accesses.map(&:site).uniq,
      "these entry points are classified for a method that no longer exists. A method " \
      "that went away takes its scope classification with it."
  end

  # The third direction, and the one that catches the interesting edit: a method
  # that already exists and has **grown an access of a kind this table does not
  # claim for it**. `apply` building a row and then writing to it is the case the
  # kind-in-the-key exists for; without this check, adding a `find` to a

    # `[key, value]` pairs, and destructuring a three-element key out of a
    # two-element pair silently files every row under `path = [path, method, kind]`
    # and leaves the lookup empty — which fails every access at once and looks
    # like a total absence of classification rather than a broken predicate.

  # --- the counts the report quotes ------------------------------------------

  # **35 data accesses, in 33 methods, filed under 34 keys.** All three numbers
  # are asserted, and neither gap between them is a rounding of the one above.
  #
  # billing-13's 33 became 35 and **both of the new ones are the account scopes
  # themselves** — `Customer.for_account` and `Subscription.for_account`, declared on
  # the two models. They are counted here for the reason the five existing scopes are:
  # a scope is a query, and `Subscription#for_account` is the query every
  # row-addressed `/v1` action reaches a subscription through, so it is an entry
  # point whose scope somebody decided rather than one that arrived by nobody writing
  # it down. Both are `list`: a scope returns a relation, and a relation is a
  # collection read whatever it is later chained to.
  #
  # Nothing was **removed** in billing-21, which is the more interesting half: the five
  # `/v1` customer and subscription rows were re-expressed from `Customer.all` and
  # `Subscription.find` into `for_account(...)`, and the scanner's `ACCESS_EXPRESSIONS`
  # gained the two patterns that keep them in the enumeration. Without those patterns
  # this count would have fallen by five on the day the boundary landed, and a matrix
  # whose total drops when the tenant boundary is fixed is a matrix that can no longer
  # notice it moving again.
  #
  # Two methods still do two things, for two different reasons:
  #
  #   * `Subscriptions::Lifecycle#customer` performs **two lookups** —
  #     `Customer.find_by(id: cafaye_customer_id)` and
  #     `Customer.find_by(processor_customer_id:)` — under one description,
  #     because one row can be found by either identifier and a delivery may
  #     carry only one. So there are more accesses than keys.
  #   * `Subscriptions::Lifecycle#apply` builds a row that did not exist **and**
  #     writes to the one that did, so it has two keys. So there are more keys
  #     than methods.
  #
  # A single number would have hidden both, and both are the shape of the code.
