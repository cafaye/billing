# Cross-account behaviour on the HTTP surface, and the `403` audit.
#
# # What changed in billing-21, and why the four characterisation tests are gone
#
# billing-12 wrote four `gap:` tests that asserted **another account's row was
# reachable** — a green test saying precisely what was true, coupled to
# `account_scoped_queries` so it would go red the moment scoping landed and say what
# to do about it. That is what happened: billing-21 landed the scoping and those four
# failed with their own instructions.
#
# They are **rewritten, not deleted, and they are the same tests.** Same two accounts
# from `test/support/two_accounts.rb`, same sentinel on account B's row, same `PATCH`,
# same listing — **the assertion is now the opposite one**, and it is worth saying
# what changed rather than only that:
#
#   * A uuid naming another account's row is a **404**, byte for byte the answer a
#     uuid naming nothing gets. The two are compared with `==` in
#     `ADDRESSED_BY_UUID.each` below, which is the strongest statement available: it
#     is not "B's row is hidden" but "B's row is indistinguishable from no row at all".
#   * The `PATCH` **changes nothing**, asserted with `drifted_ids` so the failure
#     names which row moved without printing another account's billing data.
#   * The listing **omits** B's subscription, asserted with `refute_includes` on the
#     id rather than on the payload.
#
# A test that proved the defect could not have been written from scratch after the fix
# without re-deciding what the defect was, and the risk of quietly proving something
# easier is exactly what a regression test is supposed to remove.
#
# # The 403 audit, and the one line it now allows
#
# `Problem::CATALOG` gained `unauthorized` (401) in billing-21 — the token check needs
# one and 401 is core's own reserved code. **It still has no 403**, and that is the
# property this file exists to hold: a caller whose token is good but who named
# another account's row gets the same 404 as one naming nothing, because a 403 says
# "this exists, you may not have it" and a caller walking uuids would learn exactly
# which rows exist without reading one.
#
# The source scan below now matches `403` and `forbidden` rather than
# `403|forbidden|:unauthorized`, and that change is deliberate: `:unauthorized` was
# in the pattern as a proxy for "a status this service must not render", and billing-21
# established that 401 is one it must. What is banned is unchanged and is what the
# scan still looks for.

  # --- the 403 audit --------------------------------------------------------

  # **Zero 403s, and it is structural rather than a survey.**
  #
  # The brief's rule is that a 403 on a resource the caller cannot see is an
  # enumeration oracle: it says "this exists, you may not have it", where a 404
  # says nothing. So the check is not "we did not write a 403 today" but "this
  # service has no way to emit one" — the problem vocabulary is a **frozen table**,
  # `Problem::CATALOG`, and a status outside it cannot be rendered at all.
  #
  # That makes the guarantee a property of a closed set rather than of a review,
  # which is why it is asserted against the whole table and not against a grep.
  # **401 joined the table in billing-21** (`unauthorized`), which is core's own
  # reserved code and is about the *caller*; 403 did not, and the list below is the
  # statement that it still has not.
  test "read: this service cannot emit a 403, so it cannot be an enumeration oracle" do

    refute_includes statuses, 403,
      "a 403 was added to the problem vocabulary. A 403 on a resource the caller cannot " \
      "see distinguishes it from one that does not exist, which is exactly the " \
      "enumeration oracle this service must not have. Use 404, or nil at the query."
    assert_equal statuses.uniq.sort, [ 400, 401, 404, 409, 422, 500, 503 ],

      "for the token check, and is about the caller. This service answers 404 for absence, " \
      "never 403."
  end

  # **The 401 is a code this service added deliberately and it is in core's reserved

  #
  # **Two changes, both deliberate.**
  #
  # `:unauthorized` is out of the pattern: it was there as a proxy for "a status this

  # is the token check. What is banned, and what this still scans for, is a 403.
  #
  # **Comment lines are dropped before the scan**, and that makes the check stronger
  # rather than weaker. It used to match prose, so a file explaining *why* there is no
  # 403 was reported as an offender and the only way to write the explanation was to
  # not write it — which is how a rule ends up undocumented and therefore
  # unenforceable. Stripping `#` lines means the scan can only be satisfied by code, and

    # Two shapes, because scoping can arrive in either: a `where`/`find_by` with
    # `account_id:` or `owner_id:` in it, or a named scope.

    # **`\b` on the scope name is load-bearing.** Without it `scope :for_account`
    # also matches `scope :for_account_disabled`, so a refactor that renamed the
    # scope in order to turn it off would leave this count untouched and the
    # boundary tests above asserting a scope that no longer exists. This was not
    # hypothetical: that is the mutation that caught the `> 0` assertion above.
