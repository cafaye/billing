# Three cross-tenant defects billing-12 found, and the three refusals that close
# them.
#
# ## What changed in this file, and why it is the same file
#
# billing-12 wrote these six tests to **document** F1, F2 and F3: each asserted
# that the defect was present, coupled itself to the thing that would remove it,
# and said in its own failure message that landing the fix should turn it red with
# an instruction to delete it. That was the right shape for a packet that reports
# findings, and it is why every one of them went red the moment
# `REPORT-billing-13-fixes.md`'s work landed.
#
# They are **replaced rather than deleted**, and they are the same tests: the same
# two accounts from `test/support/two_accounts.rb`, the same
# `customer.subscription.updated` delivery naming the other account's customer,
# the same `PATCH` on a caller's own row carrying a victim's `cus_`, the same pair
# of plans charging different amounts. **The setup is untouched. Only the
# assertion changed** — from "the row moved" to "the row did not move, and here is
# the refusal that stopped it".
#
# That is deliberate and it is the point. A test that proved the defect could not
# have been written from scratch after the fix without re-deciding what the
# defect was, and the risk of quietly proving something easier is exactly what a
# regression test is supposed to remove.
#
# The names change, because a test called "a delivery naming a different customer
# moves the subscription between accounts" that asserts it did **not** is a lie in
# the name, and the next person to read it would believe the first half. The
# `F1`/`F2`/`F3` prefix is kept, so `declared_finding_labels` below still derives
# the three findings from the file rather than from a constant.
#
# ## Where each fix actually lives, and what is therefore *not* here
#
#   * **F1** is a comparison in `Subscriptions::Lifecycle#apply`, raising
#     `Subscriptions::Refused` with the seventh reason, `account_mismatch`. The
#     delivery row carries `ignored:account_mismatch` and the endpoint answers
#     200 — a refusal is a decision, not an error. The 200 is asserted over the
#     HTTP edge in `test/integration/stripe_webhook_test.rb`, where the signing
#     path lives; here the assertions are about what happened to the row.
#   * **F2** and **F3** are unique indexes,
#     `customers_processor_customer_id_idx` and `plans_processor_price_id_idx`,
#     plus the model validations that turn a violation into a named 409.
#
# **The indexes are not proved here.** These tests run inside a transaction, and a
# `PG::UniqueViolation` aborts it — so a test that tried to show the *index*
# refusing would poison every assertion after it. That is what the two migration
# tests are for (`test/models/customer_processor_customer_id_migration_test.rb`,
# `test/models/plan_processor_price_id_migration_test.rb`), in files of their own
# because running a migration commits the enclosing transaction. This file proves
# the **API contract**: a caller who tries gets a refusal, and a refusal names the
# field.

  # --- F1: a delivery naming another account is refused -----------------------

  # **The refusal.** `Subscriptions::Lifecycle#apply` now compares the account the
  # delivery resolves to against the account already on the row, and refuses
  # before `assign_attributes` overwrites it.
  #
  # **Why the model could not catch it, which is the reason this was a finding.**
  # `Subscription#account_is_the_customers_owner` does compare an account against
  # a customer, and it is the only such check in the service. It passed: the new
  # account really does belong to the new customer, so the write was internally
  # consistent. What it cannot see is that the account **changed**, because the
  # rule it enforces is "a subscription's account is its customer's" and not "a
  # subscription's account does not move". The comparison had to be added to the
  # only writer, which is `Lifecycle`.
  #
  # **Asserted as the refusal and not only as an absence.** Four facts, and each
  # of them is a way the defect used to be observable: the row is byte-identical,
  # it still belongs to the account that paid, the delivery row records *which*
  # reason, and nothing was published. A guard that stopped the write but still
  # published an update would pass the first two and fail the fourth.

    # The event's `id` is merged into the body, which is what
    # `Webhooks::StripeController` does in production: the delivery's id and the
    # payload that arrived with it are one value. A helper that varied one without
    # the other would arrange a state Stripe never sends, and the outbox's unique
    # index over `processor_event_id` would then turn a correct test into a
    # duplicate-delivery refusal.
    #
    # The updated event is one second later because the lifecycle refuses a
    # delivery that is not strictly newer than the one that last wrote the row
    # (`stale_delivery`). A second delivery at the *same* processor timestamp is
    # not stale — epoch seconds are coarse — but it would then be refused as
    # `no_change_to_record` if the two deliveries agreed about everything, and the
    # finding here is a delivery that disagrees. It is also *not* the ordering that
    # lets F1's guard fire first: the account comparison happens after the machine
    # and the stale check, so a test that relied on their order would be testing
    # the order rather than the account.
