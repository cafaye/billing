# Two accounts, side by side, for the tenant-isolation specs.
#
# ## Why a shared module and not a helper in each file
#
# The negative tests only mean something if **the same two accounts** are on both
# sides of every comparison, and an id that drifts between two files is a
# comparison that quietly stops being one. So the accounts, their customers, their
# plans and their subscriptions are built here once, and every spec reaches for
# the same pair.
#
# ## The ids are obviously fake, and that is the point
#
# `cus_FAKE…`, `sub_FAKE…`, `price_FAKE…`, `evt_FAKE…` and the account uuids are
# all generated per run from a fixed prefix. A Stripe id is a real-looking string
# in a real system, and a fixture that looks like one is a fixture somebody could
# mistake for a captured production value. These cannot be mistaken for anything:
# `FAKE` is in the prefix of every processor id, and the account uuids are the
# constant `1111…` / `2222…` pair, which is not a value any system mints.
#
# ## What is built, and what each account is for
#
# Each account gets **one account-owned customer**, which is the only kind that
# can hold a subscription (`Subscription::BILLABLE_OWNER_TYPE`), and one live
# subscription on a shared plan. One plan is deliberately shared: the
# live-uniqueness index is over `(account_id, plan_id)`, so the interesting case is
# two accounts on the *same* plan, and a fixture that gave each its own plan could
# not tell a correct index from a missing one.

  # A per-row digest of the stored columns, keyed by id — safe to put in a failure
  # message.
  #
  # The cross-account specs want to assert that a write "changed nothing" for the
  # other account, and the obvious way to write that is to compare the rows —
  # which, on failure, prints a whole other account's subscription, price and
  # status into the test output. **This digest exists so that never happens.** A
  # `sha256` per row says "byte-identical" without saying what the bytes were, and
  # `drifted_ids` below then names *which* ids moved rather than what they held.
  #
  # It is a **hash keyed by id**, not a single digest, because "which rows moved"
  # and "did anything move" are two questions and only the first needs the
  # individual values. A single digest over a whole set answers the second and
  # makes the first unanswerable — `before[record.id]` on a String is a substring
  # search, which is `nil` for every uuid, so every row reports as drifted and the
  # assertion is true on every run including the ones it exists to catch.
  #
  # `created_at` and `updated_at` are excluded on purpose: `updated_at` moves on
  # every write, so including it would make "the row was touched" indistinguishable
  # from "the row's billing data changed", and the former is not what these specs
  # are about.
