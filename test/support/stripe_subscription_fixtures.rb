# The local records a Stripe subscription fixture resolves to.
#
# A subscription event is only acted on when it can be attached to a cafaye
# customer and a cafaye plan — a subscription this service did not sell is not one
# it bills, and the delivery is recorded as `unknown_customer` / `unknown_plan`
# rather than matched to whoever shares an id. Every spec that ingests a
# subscription fixture therefore needs those two records, with the *processor's*
# ids on them, or the event is refused and the spec is asserting a refusal it did
# not mean to arrange.
#
# These helpers live here rather than in each spec so that the ids the fixtures
# carry and the ids the records answer to cannot drift apart in four places. The
# ids are the ones in the committed fixtures, so a fixture edited without its
# helpers failing is a fixture nobody looked at.
#
# ## A second row gets a second id, and why that is a correctness fix
#
# Both helpers used to default to one constant, so a spec that asked for two
# customers or two plans got **two rows claiming one `cus_`/`price_`**. That was
# invisible until billing-13 made both columns unique
# (`customers_processor_customer_id_idx`, `plans_processor_price_id_idx`), at
# which point every spec building more than one of either failed with a unique
# violation.
#
# The collision was never something a spec *meant* to arrange — it was an artifact
# of a shared default — so the fix is the default, not 85 call sites. **The first
# call in a test still gets the fixture's id**, because that id is load-bearing: it
# is what the committed subscription fixtures carry, and a spec that ingests one
# needs its customer and its plan to answer to it. Every later call gets a
# distinct, obviously-fake id, so a spec can build the second plan it needs
# without its rows colliding.
#
# The on-sale price ids are a **closed list on purpose**, because
# `FakeStripeAPI` refuses a price it does not know and a plan whose price the
# fake has never heard of is a plan the processor turns down. A spec that puts a
# plan on sale therefore needs its price to be one this processor knows. The list
# and `FakeStripeAPI::KNOWN_PRICES` are two literals that have to agree, so
# `test/support/fixture_processor_ids_test.rb` asserts that they do rather than
# leaving the agreement to a comment.
