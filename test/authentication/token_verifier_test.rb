# The verifier itself, against real RSA signatures.
#
# # Nothing here is a fake
#
# The keys are generated, the tokens are signed, and the signatures are checked by
# the same code path production uses. What is replaced is the **fetch**: the JWKS
# comes from a callable rather than from identity, because a spec that fetched from
# a real identity would fail when identity is down and pass when it is up — the
# wrong axis. Every refusal below is arranged by presenting a token this suite
# minted that differs from an accepted one in exactly one way.
#
# # Each refusal is a distinct test, and the reason is worth stating
#
# "an invalid token is refused" is satisfied by a verifier that refuses everything,
# including a correct token. So each test names **which** thing was wrong, and there
# is a separate test that a correct token is **accepted** — so a verifier that
# refused everything fails rather than passing every refusal above it. That pairing
# is the whole reason this file can be believed.

  # comment says why — a user is in a personal account and usually several team
  # accounts, and one of them in the token "would be wrong for all the others."
  #
  # The test asserts this is **refused**, and the reason it is worth a test rather
  # than a comment is the shape of the temptation. Every "helpful" resolution here
  # is a silent cross-tenant read: take `accounts[0]`, take the personal one, take
  # the one whose slug matches a path segment. A user in five accounts then has
  # every request answered against a tenancy key nobody chose and nobody can see.
  # A lockout is the correct answer to an undecided disagreement; a guess is not,
  # and this is the assertion that keeps the next engineer from making one.

  # **Comment lines are skipped**, and that is not a convenience: two files
  # *explain* the rule in prose containing the word — `authenticates_principal.rb`
  # quotes core's "Inbound webhooks are not JWT-authenticated" — and a scan that
  # trips on the explanation of a rule is a scan whose only fix is to delete the
  # explanation.
  #
  # It matches the bare constant name and **not** `JWT.something`, which is a
  # narrower pattern than it looks and this file learned that by mutation: a
  # reference to `JWT::JWK` — a constant use, exactly what the rule forbids — does
  # not contain the characters `JWT.`, so the first spelling of this guard
  # reported green against a file doing precisely the thing it exists to catch.
  # Every spelling of the constant ends in `JWT` or begins with it.
  #
  # What a second `JWT.decode` would cost is the point: a second verifier is a
  # second answer to "is this caller who they say they are", and only one of them
  # would carry the RS256 pin, the `kid` check, the refresh budget and the claim
  # rules above. A caller who found the weaker one would be authenticated by it.
