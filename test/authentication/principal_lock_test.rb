# THE LOCK. `/v1` cannot be reached without a valid identity token, and everything
# that is not `/v1` still can.
#
# # What this file is, and why the assertions are shaped this way
#
# The brief's own failure mode is "a billing API with auth that degrades open", so
# every refusal here is asserted in **both** directions that matter:
#
#   1. **Every `/v1` operation is refused without a token** — and the list comes
#      from `config/routes.rb`, not from a table written here. A test that named
#      the fourteen paths in this file would pass while a route added tomorrow went
#      out unauthenticated, which is the one thing this file exists to prevent.
#   2. **Every operation that is NOT a client operation still works with no token**
#      — the probes (an orchestrator has no credential) and the Stripe webhook (its
#      sender is a processor, and core's conventions say inbound webhooks are
#      signed, never JWT-authenticated). Also derived from the router.
#
# The direction that finds things is the first one. That is deliberate and it is
# why it reads the route table.
#
# # Why the two locks are 401 and 503, and not one of them
#
#   * **No token, or a token that is wrong** — the caller's problem, and a 401 is
#     the answer that tells them so. One fixed body for all of it: which of
#     signature / expiry / issuer / audience was wrong is not something a caller
#     learns by trying.
#   * **No identity configured, or identity unreachable** — *our* problem, and a
#     401 would tell a caller holding a perfectly good token to go and rotate it.
#     This is the same reasoning the webhook uses for a missing signing secret.
#
# So the two are asserted separately, and **the 503 assertions are the ones that
# prove the lock fails closed**: a deployment that has not configured identity
# refuses every request rather than serving every request.
