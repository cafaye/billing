  # is an arbitrary constant lookup driven by a string anyone who can set an
  # environment variable can write, which in a service that seals customer money
  # is not a seam worth having. So the exporter is named by Rails configuration
  # (`config.x.telemetry.exporter`, one line per environment file), the name is
  # matched against a `case`, and anything unrecognised RAISES rather than
  # defaulting: an exporter that silently became `otlp` because of a typo is a
  # service that stopped exporting into the suite and nobody would know why.
