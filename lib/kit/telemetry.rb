module Kit
  # OpenTelemetry for billing, and the boundary that keeps it empty of content.
  #
  # WHAT THIS MODULE IS. Three things and no more:
  #
  #   * the CONTRACT with a collector — one endpoint variable, on by default;
  #   * the RESOURCE every span is exported under — service name, version,
  #     environment, tenant;
  #   * `record/2`, the ONE place a span attribute may be set.
  #
  # The last one is the whole of the redaction boundary, and its realistic
  # failure is not an attacker. It is a well-meaning engineer in six months
  # adding `span.set_attribute("customer.email", customer.email)` because it
  # would help debug a subscription, in the one service in the fleet whose rows
  # carry a customer's email, a processor id and a price in minor units. So the
  # list is the assertion, `record/2` is a choke point rather than a convention,
  # and `test/observability/canary_test.rb` plants a canary in every field a
  # caller controls and fails if it reaches an exportable attribute.
  #
  # WHY THIS FILE IS IN `lib/` AND NOT `app/lib/`, AND WHY IT IS REQUIRED
  # EXPLICITLY. It is loaded during boot, by `config/application.rb`, because the
  # middleware stack is assembled before the autoloader is set up — and a class
  # constant referenced from `config/application.rb` cannot come from an autoload
  # path without autoloading during initialization, which Rails refuses. Hence
  # `lib/` and `config.autoload_lib(ignore: %w[… kit …])`. The cost is that a new
  # file under `lib/kit/` needs a `require`; there are two of them and they are
  # in `config/application.rb` and `lib/middleware/request_telemetry.rb`.
  #
  # WHY `opentelemetry-instrumentation-rails` IS NOT HERE. Its `use_all!` records
  # `http.target`, `url.full`, `url.query` and request headers as its own span
  # attributes. Those are exactly the values a redacting collector strips, so
  # depending on the engine to strip them would make billing's boundary ONE
  # control where this repository insists on TWO. The middleware in
  # `lib/middleware/request_telemetry.rb` is hand-rolled so that what billing
  # records is only what `ALLOWED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTES` permits.
  module Telemetry
    # The prefix of every span name this service emits, and the `service.name`
    # resource. Core's span-naming grammar is `<service>.<area>.<action>`; the
    # service segment is `billing`, which is also this service's event prefix, so
    # a span and an event about the same thing read alike.
    SPAN_NAME_PREFIX = "billing"

    # The one request span. `.http.request` rather than `.web.request` because
    # this service has no HTML.
    REQUEST_SPAN_NAME = "#{SPAN_NAME_PREFIX}.http.request"

    # `<SERVICE>_OTEL_ENDPOINT` is the ONLY contract between a service and an
    # observability backend (core D16). Unset, it is the collector that ships
    # with kit's stack — which is why observability is ON BY DEFAULT rather than
    # something a deployer has to assemble. Point it at anything speaking OTLP
    # and billing goes there instead; bring-your-own is a supported deployment,
    # not a degraded mode.
    ENDPOINT_VARIABLE = "BILLING_OTEL_ENDPOINT"

    # The address that endpoint variable defaults to. Written here as well as in
    # `docker-compose.yml` because the value is a claim about two places agreeing,
    # and `test/observability/telemetry_test.rb` holds the two to one value.
    DEFAULT_ENDPOINT = "http://otel-collector:4318"

    # `tenant_id` is a RESOURCE attribute and never a span attribute — see
    # `resource/1` and the cardinality note on `ALLOWED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTES`.
    TENANT_VARIABLE = "BILLING_TENANT_ID"

    # THE ALLOWLIST. Every name here is a core semantic-convention key or a
    # closed vocabulary this service defines, and every name that is NOT here is
    # dropped by `record/2`.
    #
    # The four, and why each is bounded rather than merely allowed:
    #
    #   * `http.request.method` — eight values in HTTP/1.1 and nine in HTTP/2.
    #   * `http.response.status_code` — an integer. Bounded by the protocol.
    #   * `http.route` — ONE VALUE PER ENDPOINT, because it is the route TEMPLATE
    #     (`/v1/customers/:id`) and never the concrete path. This is the
    #     cardinality guarantee: a template has as many values as there are
    #     endpoints, and a concrete path has one per request, so a path here would
    #     mint a metric series per request in kit's collector's `spanmetrics`
    #     connector and would be a content leak at the same time.
    #   * `error.type` — a CLOSED vocabulary of this service's own, below. It is
    #     an enum rather than an exception class name because a class name is
    #     whatever the standard library happened to call it and would grow a new
    #     label the first time a dependency renamed an error.
    #
    # What is deliberately ABSENT, and each absence is a decision rather than an
    # oversight:
    #
    #   * `url.path` / `url.query` / `url.full` / `http.target` — the path is
    #     caller-controlled text and the query string carries an email.
    #   * `http.request.header.*` — a bearer token, a session cookie or an
    #     `Idempotency-Key` in an attribute is a credential in a searchable,
    #     retained, widely-readable store.
    #   * `enduser.id` / `customer.id` / `account_id` — a tenant is the resource,
    #     not a measurement. On a span, `account_id` is unbounded cardinality by
    #     another name.
    #   * `stripe.*` / `messaging.*` — the processor's own vocabulary, and this
    #     service's payload is core's contract, not telemetry's.

    # THE CHOKE POINT.
    #
    #   record(span, attributes) -> span
    #
    # Sets only the attributes on `ALLOWED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTES`, drops the rest, and
    # returns the span so it can be threaded.
    #
    # Every drop is silent on purpose and the silence is worth defending: a
    # logger here would print the value it just refused, which in the case this
    # function exists for is exactly the leak. `test/observability/allowlist_test.rb`
    # asserts the drops, and asserts that a name carrying a word that means
    # content cannot be added to the list at all.
    #
    # The NAME is allowlisted and ONE VALUE is validated, and the asymmetry is
    # deliberate. `error.type` is the only attribute whose values are a closed
    # vocabulary rather than a closed *kind*, and a name check alone would let
    # `error.type` carry `PG::ConnectionBad` — unbounded cardinality from a
    # library's own naming, which is the thing the closed list exists to prevent.
    # The other three have bounded value spaces by construction (a method, a status
    # code, a route template), so a name check is the whole check they need.
