# The request span, and the whole of billing's HTTP telemetry.
#
# A Rack middleware rather than `opentelemetry-instrumentation-rack`, and the
# reason is in `Kit::Telemetry`: the contrib instrumentation records `http.target`,
# `url.full`, `url.query` and request headers as its own span attributes. Those are
# exactly the values a redacting collector strips, so depending on the engine to
# strip them would make billing's boundary ONE control where this repository
# insists on TWO. Hand-rolled, billing records only what the allowlist permits.
#
# WHY IT SITS AT THE VERY OUTSIDE OF THE STACK. Two halves of what it records pull
# in opposite directions, and the placement is the resolution of both:
#
#   * the STATUS is on the response, so it can only be read after `@app.call`
#     returns — reading it before would read the status Rack was about to write
#     over;
#   * the ROUTE is in `env["action_dispatch.request.path_parameters"]`, which Rails
#     fills in WHILE routing, on the same env hash this middleware holds. An outer
#     middleware that kept the env would see it; one that read it on the way IN
#     would not, and a 404 and a 405 would have no span at all.
#
# A 404 is therefore covered, and it is covered with NO route: the path of an
# unmatched request is caller-controlled text, so recording it is the cardinality
# bomb and the content leak in one move. The 404 status is the answer.
#
# `start_span` + an explicit `finish`, and NOT `tracer.in_span`. Two reasons, both
# about what `in_span` puts on a span of its own accord:
#
#   * `in_span` calls `span.record_exception(e)` by default, which attaches the
#     exception's CLASS NAME, MESSAGE and STACKTRACE as a span EVENT — and an
#     event is exported. An exception message in this service is built three frames
#     up from what a caller sent, and `test/integration/secrets_do_not_leak_test.rb`
#     exists because that is where leaks live.
#   * `in_span` then sets the status description to
#     `"Unhandled exception of type: #{e.class}"`, which is an exception class name
#     on an exported span, written by code this repository does not control and
#     cannot allowlist.
#
# So the span's status, its attributes and its events are all decided here, where
# they can be allowlisted. The span still ENDS with an error status and an
# `error.type` from a closed vocabulary — the failure is fully visible, and nothing
# about it is free text.
