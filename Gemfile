# Stripe, the payment processor. This build uses exactly one thing from it:
# `Stripe::Webhook.construct_event`, the signature verification for inbound
# webhooks. There is no API client here — this service receives, it does not
# call out to Stripe. The gem is here because the signature scheme (HMAC-SHA256
# over `timestamp.body` with a tolerance window) is the processor's contract,
# and re-implementing it would be a hand-rolled crypto path in the one place a
# forged amount must never be believed.

# OpenTelemetry. The trace SDK and the OTLP exporter, and the reason each is named
# here is in app/lib/kit/telemetry.rb: without them billing cannot emit a span at
# all, and the collector kit ships with the stack has nothing to redact.
#
# In EVERY group, including test: `BILLING_OTEL_ENDPOINT` is ON BY DEFAULT (core
# D16), so a developer running `bin/rails server` exports into the collector that
# ships with the stack, and a deployer gets traces without assembling them.
# Gating the exporter to production would make the default a no-op everywhere it
# is actually used, which is backwards — and it would make the redaction tests in
# this repository assert nothing, because a suite with no exporter exports nothing.
#
# Deliberately NOT added, each with a reason rather than a preference:
#
#   * opentelemetry-instrumentation-rails / -rack. `use_all!` records
#     `http.target`, `url.full`, `url.query` and request headers as its own span
#     attributes. Those are exactly the values a redacting collector strips, and
#     depending on the engine to strip them would make billing's boundary ONE
#     control where this repository insists on TWO. Hence a hand-rolled Rack
#     middleware in app/middleware/, which records only what
#     `Kit::Telemetry::ALLOWED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTES` permits.
#   * opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-metrics. Metrics come from kit's collector's
#     `spanmetrics` connector, which derives them from spans AFTER redaction — so
#     a derived metric can never carry a dimension the allowlist stripped, and
#     there is no second definition of the same series anywhere in the fleet.
#   * opentelemetry-instrumentation-logger / opentelemetry-logs. Logs are the
#     container's stdout: compose's `logging:` driver ships them to the
#     collector's `syslog/crash` receiver, which makes a panic a log record with a
#     `service.name` on it and adds no per-language dependency to this repository.
