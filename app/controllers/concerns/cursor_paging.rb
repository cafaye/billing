# Cursor pagination, because core's openapi-conventions.md requires it on every
# collection and offset pagination cannot stay stable while rows are being
# inserted.
#
# A cursor is base64url of `{at, id}`: the last row of the page, by the same
# order the page was read in. The `id` is the tiebreaker, which is what makes
# the keyset total — two rows written in the same millisecond still have an
# order, and no row is repeated or skipped across a page boundary.
#
# It is base64url and nothing more. core calls a cursor opaque and says its
# encoding may change without notice, and a *signed* cursor would need a shared
# secret that this service does not have yet. Until it does, a crafted cursor
# can only ask for a different page of the same collection, and v0's endpoints
# are unauthenticated anyway (README). Signing it is a one-line change here when
# a secret exists, and the client is unaffected either way — that is the point
# of calling it opaque.
