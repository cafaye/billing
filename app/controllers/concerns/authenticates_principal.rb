# Who is calling, on `/v1` and nowhere else.
#
# ## Where this sits, and why it is not a middleware
#
# A middleware would put the check on paths, and the paths here are the thing that
# must not be got wrong: `/v1/customers` is a cafaye client surface,
# `/v1/webhooks/stripe` is a *processor* surface authenticated by signature, and
# `/healthz` is infrastructure. A path-prefixed check gets "all of /v1" wrong in the
# direction that matters — it would put a token requirement on the webhook, which
# core's conventions forbid ("Inbound webhooks are **not** JWT-authenticated") and
# which would be a second, weaker trust path to the same door.
#
# So this is a `before_action` on `V1::BaseController`, and it is inherited by
# exactly the three controllers the router draws inside `scope "/v1", module: :v1`.
# `Webhooks::BaseController` does not inherit from it, cannot reach it, and
# `config.action_controller.raise_on_missing_callback_actions = true` means a
# future controller in that namespace cannot silently skip the filter by not
# naming an action. `test/authentication/principal_lock_test.rb` asserts the
# boundary from the router's own table rather than from this paragraph.
#
# ## The three refusals, and the statuses
#
#   * `Identity::Unconfigured`, `Identity::Unreachable` -> **503**. This service
#     cannot check the credential right now. A 401 would tell a caller holding a
#     valid token to go and rotate it, which is the wrong instruction and sends an
#     operator to the wrong system — the same reasoning the webhook uses when the
#     signing secret is missing, and the same one `Problem::CATALOG`'s 503 title
#     exists for.
#   * `Identity::Invalid`, and a request with no bearer token at all -> **401**.
#
# **The failure mode that matters is the one that degrades OPEN.** There is no
# branch anywhere in this file that lets a request through without a verified
# principal: no default account, no "authentication is disabled in development",
# no rescue that renders a 200. If the verifier is missing, broken, or cannot reach
# identity, `/v1` is locked, and that is asserted rather than asserted-in-prose.
#
# ## 401, never 403
#
# `Problem::CATALOG` has no 403 and this file does not add one. A caller whose
# token is fine but who asked about somebody else's row gets the **same 404** a
# caller asking about a row that does not exist gets — absence, never refusal —
# because a 403 says "this exists, you may not have it", which is an enumeration
# oracle. The mechanism for that is `for_account`, not a status.
