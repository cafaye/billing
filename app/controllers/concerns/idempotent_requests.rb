# `Idempotency-Key` on the mutating POSTs, per core's openapi-conventions.md.
#
# The controller asks two questions through this module and nothing else:
#
#   replayed_response  -> a stored [status, body] to send instead of doing the
#                         work again, or nil if the key is new
#   remember_response  -> store what was actually sent
#
# Keeping the storage behind those two calls is what makes the rules checkable:
# a retried POST must not write a second row, and a replay must return the
# bytes the client already saw rather than a freshly rendered equivalent.
