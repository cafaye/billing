#   GET /healthz -> liveness. Answers as long as the process is serving requests.
#                  It touches no dependency on purpose: a liveness check that
#                  fails when the database is slow causes a restart storm.
#   GET /readyz  -> readiness. Verifies the one dependency this service cannot
#                  serve traffic without (PostgreSQL) and answers 503 when it
#                  is unavailable, so the load balancer stops sending requests.
