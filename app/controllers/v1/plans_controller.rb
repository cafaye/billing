module V1
  # /v1/plans — what can be bought, at what price, on what cadence.
  #
  # The addressing is deliberately asymmetric, and it is the packet's shape
  # rather than an oversight: `GET /v1/plans/:slug` reads a plan by the handle
  # that appears in a URL a human or a pricing page would use, while
  # `PATCH /v1/plans/:id` writes by the uuid, because a slug can be changed by
  # the very request being made and a mutable handle is not a safe thing to
  # address a mutation by. Both are 404 for the other's identifier, and the
  # specs say so.
  #
  # # A plan carries no account, and that is the model, not a gap in the scoping
  #
  # Every `/v1` operation needs a token now (`AuthenticatesPrincipal`), but the two
  # controllers that reach **tenant rows** — customers and subscriptions — scope
  # their queries by `account_id` and this one does not, because a plan has no
  # `account_id` column: a plan is what an account may **buy**, not what an account
  # owns. `test/support/two_accounts.rb` deliberately shares ONE plan between both
  # accounts for the same reason, and `subscriptions_live_account_plan_idx` is keyed
  # on `(account_id, plan_id)` because the plan is shared and the account is not.
  #
  # **What is still open is who may WRITE the catalogue.** `POST /v1/plans` and
  # `PATCH /v1/plans/:id` change what every account is offered and at what price, so
  # they are a capability question and core's answer is `scopes` — not tenancy. No
  # client in this build holds a billing scope, so **any authenticated caller can
  # currently write the catalogue**. That is recorded in `README.md` rather than
  # papered over with a check that cannot be satisfied, and `Principal#scopes` is
  # where the check goes once there is a vocabulary to check against. Inventing a
  # scope name here would lock every deployment out of its own catalogue for the
  # sake of a check no token could pass.
