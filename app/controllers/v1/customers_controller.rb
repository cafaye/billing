module V1
  # /v1/customers — the billing-side record of something identity knows about.
  #
  # # Scoped by the caller's account, and it always was able to be
  #
  # Every query here goes through `Customer.for_account`, which matches
  # `owner_type: "Account"` and `owner_id: <the token's account_id>`. A caller
  # authenticated as account A therefore gets A's customers and nothing else:
  #
  #   * `GET /v1/customers` returns a page of **A's** customers. Before the token
  #     existed it returned every customer's, which is the visible half of the
  #     defect billing-12 measured and this packet closes.
  #   * `GET /v1/customers/:id` and `PATCH /v1/customers/:id` resolve inside that
  #     scope, so another account's uuid is **404** — the same answer an id that
  #     names nothing gets. Not 403: a 403 says "this exists, you may not have it",
  #     which is an enumeration oracle over uuids a caller can walk.
  #   * `POST /v1/customers` **ignores `owner_type`/`owner_id` in the body** and
  #     writes the caller's own account onto the row. This is the one place where a
  #     body field and a claim could disagree, and the claim wins — core's
  #     authorization rule is "`account_id` for tenancy. Every query is scoped by
  #     `account_id` from the token, never from the request body." Honouring the
  #     body here would let any authenticated caller mint a customer owned by
  #     somebody else, which is a cross-tenant write wearing a `POST`.
  #
  # **A `User`-owned customer is no longer creatable through `/v1`,** and that is a
  # deliberate consequence rather than an oversight: a user-owned customer has no
  # account to scope by, so a row like that would be unreachable from the surface
  # that made it. It remains reachable by `owner_type`/`owner_id` on the models, and
  # by the delivery path, which resolves it by processor id. Recorded in
  # `README.md`; the `Customer` model still models both owner types.

      # `find` rather than `find_by`, and **inside `for_account`**: a row in another

      # id that could never name a row is that same answer — all three are one

      # The scope is named at the call site rather than extracted into a `scoped`
      # helper because the helper is one more hop between a reader and the fact that

      # whether account A can read account B's customer. The cost is the scope
      # appearing three times, which is the point.

      # token named.
      #
      # The split from `customer_params` is the point. `update` deliberately cannot
      # reach these two columns — a customer's owner is part of the key the
      # `(owner_type, owner_id, processor)` index is built on, so moving one is a
      # delete and a create — while `create` needs them and must take them from
      # somewhere this service controls. `owner_type` is the constant because a
      # customer this surface creates is always billed to an account; see the class
      # comment on why no `User` row is created here.
