  # /v1/subscriptions — the lifecycle a client drives.
  #
  # ## Nothing here decides a subscription's state
  #
  # Every mutating action asks the processor to do something and returns. The
  # subscription row changes when a webhook says it did, which is the rule the rest
  # of this service follows: the processor is the party that can bill, and a local
  # row that disagreed with it would grant entitlements nobody is paying for.
  # Concretely:
  #
  #   * `create` writes **no** subscription. It creates a Checkout session, because a
  #     subscription does not exist until the payment completes — and the 201 carries
  #     the session, not a resource. Inventing a local row here would mean a sixth
  #     status meaning "we asked", which is a state no processor can report.
  #   * `cancel` and `change_plan` move the processor's subscription and leave the row
  #     alone. A response claiming the subscription is canceled before the processor
  #     has said so would be a lie a client could act on.
  #
  # The exception to "the response is the row" is `change_plan`, which returns a
  # `plan_change` object alongside it. Without it a client has no way to learn that a
  # downgrade is scheduled for the end of the period rather than applied now — the
  # rule lives in `Subscriptions::PlanChange` and is otherwise invisible until a
  # webhook lands. It describes the decision this request made; it is not state, and
  # the subscription's own fields do not change.
  #
  # ## Every problem in a body is reported at once
  #
  # `refuse` records rather than renders, and an action renders once at the end. A
  # client that sent three wrong fields gets three failures, not the first one three
  # times — which is the same rule `render_validation_failure` follows for a model's
  # own errors.
  #
  # # Scoped by the caller's account
  #
  # `index` pages `Subscription.for_account(current_account_id)` — this account's
  # subscriptions, not every subscription in the database — and **every** row-addressed
  # action resolves inside that same scope: `show`, `cancel`, `change_plan` and
  # `entitlements`. So a uuid naming another account's subscription is a **404**,
  # byte for byte the answer a uuid naming nothing gets. Not 403: a 403 says "this
  # exists, you may not have it", and a caller walking uuids would learn exactly
  # which subscriptions exist without reading one. Absence, never refusal.
  #
  # `create` names the customer by `customer_id` in the body still — a Checkout
  # session needs a buyer, and the body is where a buyer goes — but the customer is
  # resolved **inside the account scope**, so a `customer_id` naming another
  # account's customer is refused as "not a record this service has" rather than
  # billing that account's card. It refuses a `User`-owned customer for the reason
  # it always did: which account a user belongs to is identity's fact, and no event
  # carrying it is in this build's `consumes`.
