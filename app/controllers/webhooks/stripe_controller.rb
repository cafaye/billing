  # Stripe's webhook endpoint: POST /v1/webhooks/stripe
  #
  # Verified with `Stripe::Webhook.construct_event` and nothing else. This service
  # receives from Stripe; it does not call the Stripe API. A signature that does
  # not verify is a body we did not receive, so it is refused and stored nowhere
  # — an unverified payload is not an event, and writing one would put an
  # attacker's JSON in the row a human reads when something is wrong.
  #
  # Statuses, all of them deliberate:
  #
  #   200 — a verified event, whatever became of it. A replay, an unknown type, a
  #         type we deliberately ignore, and an event whose mapping raised all
  #         answer 200, because each is recorded and terminal, and a processor
  #         retrying them reaches the identical outcome. A 5xx here would teach
  #         Stripe to retry a decision this service has already made, and would
  #         hide a parked row behind a timeout.
  #   400 — the signature did not verify, or the body was not an event. The
  #         sender's problem, and a 4xx is what stops a retry loop.
  #   503 — our own signing secret is not configured. Not 400: telling Stripe its
  #         signature is bad when we cannot check it at all sends an operator
  #         looking in exactly the wrong place. The cause is logged; the body says
  #         only that the service is unavailable.
  #
  # The problem bodies are the ones `ProblemResponses` builds, so the code is one
  # of core's reserved list and the trace id matches the `X-Trace-Id` header, the
  # same as a 422 from the `/v1` API.

    # Raised when a verified signature covers a body that is not an event at all:
    # unparseable JSON, or JSON with no event id or no type. There is nothing to

    # type could never be routed — so this is a 400 rather than a parked row.
