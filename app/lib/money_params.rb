# Parses a price out of a request body, or refuses it.

# The only accepted shape is `{"amount_minor": <integer>, "currency": "XXX"}` —
# minor units, as an integer. A Float is refused rather than rounded, because
# `19.00` arriving as a float has already lost the fact that it was nineteen
# dollars exactly, and a decimal string is refused for the same reason. A price
# sent as `19.50` is not a rounding bug in this code; it is a client that has
# decided a Float may carry money, and answering it correctly is how that
# belief gets fixed.
#
# The error message is a fixed sentence on purpose: it names the shape that is
# wanted and never repeats what was sent or what the parser complained about.
