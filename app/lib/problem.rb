# The response body for every non-2xx this service sends.
#
# RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` with core's extensions, built in one place
# so that no controller can invent its own error shape. The parts that are not
# negotiable, from core's openapi-conventions.md:
#
# * `type` is a stable URI and `code` is its last segment, in snake_case. That
#   URI is the machine-readable contract; the `title` next to it is a summary a
#   client may reword.
# * `detail` is specific to this occurrence and is not parsed. It is also the
#   only free-text field, which is why INTERNAL_DETAIL is a constant: a failure
#   message never returns to an HTTP caller. The cause goes to the log, and
#   support starts from the trace id.
# * `errors[]` appears only on a 422, listing the per-field failures.
