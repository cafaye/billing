# The row is the event. Nothing here publishes to anything: a dispatcher that
# claims the unpublished rows and hands them to a transport is a later packet,
# because cafaye has no broker wired up and adding a queue is a dependency
# decision this packet does not get to make (AGENTS.md). What this packet does
# fix is the part that is expensive to get wrong later: the envelope, the
# grammar, and the transaction.
#
# The row's primary key doubles as the envelope's `id`, which core defines as
# the dedupe key. A re-emission is a new row and therefore a new id, so a
# consumer that has seen an event can always tell it from the next one.

  # direction, a type that is not on this list cannot be written at all. That
  # second half is what stops a webhook mapping from parking every delivery as a
  # failure: a type that fell off the end of this list is refused at the write,
  # from inside a processor request, and answered 200.

  # Three come from model callbacks and five from the Stripe webhook mapping
  # (`Webhooks::StripeEvents::EVENT_TYPES` and the Checkout session, which
