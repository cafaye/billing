# A subscription: one account, on one plan, for one billing period at a time.
#
# The whole model turns on one fact about it: **this service never decides what a
# subscription's status is.** The processor does, it says so on a signed webhook,
# and this table is the record of what it said. Nothing here writes a status from
# a cafaye request — cancelling and changing a plan both call the processor and
# wait for the event that comes back. That is why there is no `after_create` or
# `after_update` publishing an event: the only writer of this row is
# `Subscriptions::Lifecycle`, and it is the only thing that emits a
# subscription's events, in the transaction that changed the row.
#
# The uniqueness rules are two, and the second is about a set of statuses:
#
#   * `processor_subscription_id` is UNIQUE, and that index is the resolution
#     mechanism rather than a query aid. Every event about a subscription is
#     looked up by the processor's id, so two rows for one processor subscription
#     would be two answers to one question.
#   * `(account_id, plan_id)` is UNIQUE **for live subscriptions only**. A
#     canceled subscription is history: a customer who cancels and comes back
#     has to be able to subscribe to the same plan again, and an index that did
#     not exclude `canceled` would make that impossible for the second time.
#
# `status` is a plain string with an inclusion validation and a CHECK constraint,
# for the reason `Customer#processor` and `Plan#interval` are: a Rails `enum`
# raises ArgumentError the moment an unknown value is assigned, and at an HTTP
# boundary that is a 500 for something the caller got wrong.
class Subscription < ApplicationRecord
  # The statuses this service stores. Chosen from what the processor actually
  # sends for a flat plan bought through Checkout:
  #
  #   trialing   — in a trial, has not charged yet
  #   active     — billing normally
  #   past_due   — a charge failed, the grace period is running
  #   unpaid     — collection was given up on; the processor will cancel it
  #   canceled   — over
  #
  # The processor also has `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired` and `paused`, and
  # this list is closed on purpose. A status outside it is *refused* by the
  # lifecycle with the delivery recorded, rather than coerced into one of these
  # five: a row that says `active` for a subscription the processor calls
  # `incomplete` grants entitlements nobody has paid for, and the refusal is a
  # row somebody can find. The other direction is harmless — a status this
  # service does not model is not one it can have learned. Recorded as a
  # decision in cafaye.yml.
  STATUSES = %w[trialing active past_due canceled unpaid].freeze

  # single fact is what the live-uniqueness index and the state machine are both

  TERMINAL_STATUSES = %w[canceled].freeze

  # The statuses a caller can still ask the processor to do something about:
  # cancelling one, or moving it to another plan.
  #
  # `unpaid` is excluded from both, and the reason is the same: the processor has
  # stopped collecting and is about to cancel the subscription itself, so there is
  # nothing left to ask. It is still `LIVE` — it still grants entitlements, because
  # the grace period is a product decision and not this service's to take away.
  #
  # One set rather than two because the two actions have the same boundary, and two
  # sets would be two lists to keep in step.

  # `subscriptions_live_account_plan_idx` for the uniqueness it is keyed on.
  #
  # This is the scope that makes `POST /v1/subscriptions/{id}/cancel` safe. Every
  # read on `/v1` reaches a subscription through here, so a uuid naming another
  # account's row resolves to `nil` and the action answers **404** — the same answer
  # a uuid naming nothing gets, because a 403 would tell a caller walking ids which
  # ones exist. Absence, never refusal; see `AuthenticatesPrincipal`.

  # is deliberately absent: it is the service's own ordering bookkeeping, not a
