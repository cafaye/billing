# A plan: what can be bought, at what price, on what cadence.
#
# The only way an amount enters this model is `price=`, and it takes a `Money`.
# `amount_cents` and `currency` are the two columns that amount is stored in,
# and nothing else writes them: the controller parses a request into a `Money`
# (or refuses it), the column type and a CHECK constraint refuse a negative or
# a non-integer, and `as_json` reads it back out through `price`. There is no
# code path where a Float carries a price (AGENTS.md, Money).
#
# `interval` is a plain string with an inclusion validation and a CHECK
# constraint rather than a Rails `enum`, for the reason given on Customer: an
# enum raises ArgumentError on an unknown value, and at an HTTP boundary that
# is a 500 for something the client got wrong.
