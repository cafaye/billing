# A plan: what can be bought, at what price, on what cadence.
#
# The only way an amount enters this model is `price=`, and it takes a `Money`.
# `amount_cents` and `currency` are the two columns that amount is stored in,
# and nothing else writes them: the controller parses a request into a `Money`
# (or refuses it), the column type and a CHECK constraint refuse a negative or
# a non-integer, and `as_json` reads it back out through `price`. There is no
# code path where a Float carries a price (AGENTS.md, Money).
#
# `interval` is a plain string with an inclusion validation and a CHECK
# constraint rather than a Rails `enum`, for the reason given on Customer: an
# enum raises ArgumentError on an unknown value, and at an HTTP boundary that
# is a 500 for something the client got wrong.

  # `Subscriptions::Lifecycle#plan` resolves a delivery by this column with

  # Two plans on one `price_` and one of them is billed at an amount this service

  # A plan is **platform catalogue and not tenant data**, and that is the reason
  # `V1::PlansController` resolves a plan by slug or uuid with no account filter —
  # while every customer and subscription query on `/v1` carries one.
  #
  # It is worth being explicit about why the two are different, because the matrix
  # in `test/contract/tenant_isolation_matrix_test.rb` calls a plan tenant data
  # ("a plan is the catalogue of what an account may buy") and this comment is where
  # that is resolved. A plan has **no `account_id` column**: a plan is what an
  # account may buy, not what an account owns, so every account reads the same rows.
  # `test/support/two_accounts.rb` deliberately builds ONE plan shared by both
  # accounts, and `subscriptions_live_account_plan_idx` is keyed on
  # `(account_id, plan_id)` precisely because the plan is shared and the account is
  # not — a fixture that gave each account its own plan could not tell a correct
  # index from a missing `account_id`.
  #
  # **What this does NOT settle is who may write the catalogue.** `POST /v1/plans`
  # and `PATCH /v1/plans/{id}` change what *every* account is offered and at what
  # price, so they are a capability question and core's answer is `scopes`, not
  # `account_id`. No client in this build holds a billing scope, so no scope check
  # is enforced and any authenticated caller can currently write the catalogue.
  # That is a recorded gap (`README.md`, "Known gaps") rather than a decision, and
  # `Principal#scopes` is the place it is closed.

  # The write side. Refuses anything that is not a `Money`, because the whole
  # point of the type is that a bare integer has no currency and a Float has no
  # exact value. A caller with a raw pair must build the Money itself.
