# core: a retriable POST must accept `Idempotency-Key`; a replay with the same
# key *and the same body* returns the original response with
# `Idempotency-Replayed: true`; a replay with the same key and a different body
# is a 409 `idempotency_key_reused`. Requests without the key are processed
# normally — that is the client's call, and this service does not second-guess it.
#
# Only a successful response is remembered. A 422 is the client being told what
# to fix, and freezing that answer for 24 hours would mean a client that fixes
# its body and retries with the same key still cannot get through. A retried
# failure re-evaluates, which is the only useful behaviour here.
