# An amount of money, held as an integer number of minor units.
#
# This is the seed of the platform-wide rule that money is *integer minor
# units* (PLAN §3). Consequences, all of them deliberate:
#
# * There is no Float in this file. A Float cannot represent 0.10, so it must
#   never carry an amount. Floats are rejected on the way in, not converted.
# * Nothing is rounded. Converting a major-unit amount that is smaller than one
#   minor unit raises instead of quietly losing the remainder, because a
#   silently rounded price is a bug that shows up in somebody's invoice.
# * Every operation is range-checked against the PostgreSQL bigint bounds, so a
#   value that cannot be stored is refused before it reaches the database.
# * Mixing currencies is an error, never a conversion. FX belongs in a pricing
#   decision, not in an arithmetic operator.
#
# Usage:
#
#   Money.new(1050, "USD")               #=> #<Money 10.50 USD>
#   Money.from_major("10.50", "USD")     #=> #<Money 10.50 USD>
#   Money.from_major("10.505", "USD")    # raises Money::InvalidAmountError
#   Money.new(1050, "USD") + Money.new(50, "USD")  #=> #<Money 11.00 USD>
#   Money.new(1050, "USD") * 3           #=> #<Money 31.50 USD>
#
# Currency codes are validated for ISO 4217 *shape* (three letters). The full
# list of active codes is not embedded here: a hand-maintained list of 180 codes
# is a liability in a payment system, and an unrecognised-but-well-formed code
# should not stop a new currency from being accepted before the catalogue lands.
# The exponents that differ from the usual two — zero-decimal currencies such as
# JPY and three-decimal ones such as KWD — are listed, because those are the ones
# that silently corrupt an amount if they are assumed.
