# A processor's event, as received: the raw body, verified by signature, stored
# before anything tries to interpret it, and processed at most once.
#
# The whole point of this table is that a replay is a non-event. Stripe delivers
# at-least-once and retries on any non-2xx, so the same event id will arrive
# again — immediately, or a day later — and the second arrival must not produce a
# second `payment.succeeded` with a second envelope id. `stripe_event_id` is
# UNIQUE for exactly that reason, and `ingest` turns the resulting conflict back
# into a lookup.
#
# What lives in `error` is a terminal outcome, not an error in the HTTP sense:
# a row with `processed_at` set and an `ignored:` prefix was understood and
# deliberately not acted on, and a `failed:` prefix means the row is parked for
# a human. Both answer 200, because a processor that retries a decision this
# service has already made will retry it until Stripe gives up, and the retry
# accomplishes nothing.
class ProcessorWebhook < ApplicationRecord
  # Bound on the recorded message. The class and the processor event id are what
  # a human needs to find the row; the tail of a stack-trace-shaped message is
  # not, and an unbounded text column in a table that grows by one row per
  # delivery is a liability.
