# A billing customer: something identity knows about, which billing can charge.
#
# This is billing's own row, not the person. `owner` is a reference across a
# service boundary — identity's uuid, stored as a uuid, with no foreign key and
# no Active Record association, because there is no `User` class in this process
# to associate to. The two columns are the whole contract with identity, and
# OWNER_TYPES is the list of entities billing knows how to bill.
#
# The uniqueness rule is one customer per (owner, processor). An owner can
# legitimately have a customer at two processors, and a processor migration
# must not collide on the way there.
#
# `processor` is a plain string column with an inclusion validation and a
# CHECK constraint, not a Rails `enum`. An enum raises ArgumentError the moment
# an unknown value is assigned, which at an HTTP boundary is a 500 for
# something the client got wrong; a validation is a 422 that names the field.
# The database still refuses any value outside the set, so bypassing the model
# does not get a row that the model would not have written.

  # identity's entities that can be billed. Adding one is a change to what
  # billing believes the platform is made of, which is why it is a constant here
  # rather than a free-form string.

  # The processors this service can talk to. v0 stores the name only: this

  # `allow_nil` on the inclusions for the same reason as Plan: a missing value
  # is a blank, which is one problem with one fix, not two.
