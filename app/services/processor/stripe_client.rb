module Processor
  # The whole of this service's outbound surface to Stripe.
  #
  # Three methods, and every Stripe call in this repository is one of them. That
  # is deliberate: "billing receives from Stripe" is only a claim about the code
  # while there is nowhere else for a `Stripe::` call to be. Adding a fourth
  # method is adding a capability, and the diff says so.
  #
  # The `api` keyword is the seam. Production passes nil and gets the `stripe`
  # gem; the specs pass a recorder and assert on what was *asked*. Both are the
  # same class, so a test exercises the argument building rather than a parallel
  # implementation of it — the failure mode a hand-written double invites.
  #
  # ## Nothing here is arithmetic about money
  #
  # A checkout session sends a price id. A plan change sends a proration
  # *behaviour*. A cancellation sends an id and a boolean. No amount is ever
  # computed in this file, and the specs assert the absence of the keys that
  # would carry one (`amount`, `credit`, `refund`, `prorate`).
  #
  # That is not tidiness. A figure calculated in Ruby and sent to the processor is
  # a figure this service did not keep, and the two eventually disagree — in a
  # customer's invoice, which is the worst place to find out.

    # every customer created through `/v1` in v0, so at this moment the processor
    # has no id of ours to match on. `processor_customer_id` is sent when we know
    # it, and nil is passed explicitly when we do not, which asks the processor to
    # create the customer and tell us about it in the subscription.
