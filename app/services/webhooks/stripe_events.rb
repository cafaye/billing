module Webhooks
  # Turns a verified processor payload into this service's own events.
  #
  # The two things it exists to guarantee:
  #
  #   * **Nothing is invented.** A field the processor did not send is absent from
  #     the normalized hash rather than defaulted. A webhook payload is the
  #     weakest input in the system — JSON from the internet, shaped by a third
  #     party — and a default that silently fills a gap is how a customer ends up
  #     on a plan nobody charged them for.
  #   * **The processor's shape stops here.** Everything downstream sees
  #     snake_case keys and integer minor units, so a second processor, or a
  #     change in the processor's payload, is a change in one file.
  #
  # Normalization is separate from emission on purpose: a normalized hash can be
  # asserted on directly, and the same hash feeds every event type that describes
  # the same underlying fact.
  #
  # Every event type below is a member of `OutboxEvent::TYPES` and a row in this
  # repository's `cafaye.yml`. A type that was not would be refused by the outbox
  # at the write, from inside a webhook, and answered 200 — an outage nobody sees
  # until a processor's dashboard does.

    # arbitrary payload is one that will eventually be handed a payload whose
    # signature was never checked.
