module Webhooks
  # The boundary between a verified processor payload and this service's own
  # events. One object, one job: store what arrived, act on it exactly once, and
  # record how it went.
  #
  # Three properties, each of which is a test in test/services/webhooks:
  #
  #   * **At most once per processor event id.** A replay is a lookup, not a
  #     second emission. Delivery is at-least-once, so replays are ordinary
  #     operation, and the second `billing.payment.succeeded` is not a harmless
  #     duplicate — it is a second envelope id, which a consumer deduplicating on
  #     that id cannot tell from new information about money.
  #
  #   * **The event and the receipt of it are one commit.** The outbox row and
  #     the `processed_at` that says this delivery is finished are written in the
  #     same transaction, so there is no window in which one exists without the
  #     other. A process that died between two transactions would leave a row
  #     that looks unfinished, and the next delivery would emit a second event
  #     for a charge that already settled.
  #
  #   * **Never raise for a payload we have stored.** An unknown type, a
  #     deliberately ignored type, and an event whose mapping raised are all
  #     terminal states recorded on the row. A processor that retries a 5xx
  #     retries the identical payload and reaches the identical outcome, so the
  #     retry buys nothing and hides a parked row behind a timeout. The failure is
  #     raised at the edge, with the identifier needed to find the row.
  #
  #   * **Refuse a bad input before it becomes a row.** An unknown processor, a
  #     missing event id and a missing type are programming errors, not processor
  #     behaviour, and nobody can retry them into success.
  #
  # ## At most once, under concurrency
  #
  # `call` is a check followed by an act, and the first version of that sequence
  # was correct only when deliveries did not overlap:
  #
  # ```ruby
  # webhook = ProcessorWebhook.ingest(...)
  # return webhook if webhook.handled?   # the read
  # dispatch(webhook)                    # ... and the write
  # ```
  #
  # The unique index on `processor_webhooks.stripe_event_id` makes two concurrent
  # deliveries of one event id agree about *which row* they hold — and agreeing
  # about the row is not agreeing about the answer. `handled?` reads a column that
  # neither thread has written yet, because each is about to write it. Under READ
  # COMMITTED neither sees the other's uncommitted work, so both read `nil`, both
  # dispatch, and one Stripe event produces two outbox rows with two envelope
  # ids. That is a duplicate charge event, and it is the defect
  # `test/services/webhooks/concurrent_delivery_test.rb` reproduces.
  #
  # The fix is not a smarter check but a constraint that makes the duplicate
  # state *impossible*: a unique index on the outbox's processor event id
  # (`IndexOutboxEventsOnProcessorEventId`). It holds under any interleaving,
  # which is the property an application-level guard cannot have — a guard is only
  # ever right about the interleavings its author imagined.
  #
  # The loser of that race is not an error. It is a delivery that arrived, was
  # understood, and was deliberately not acted on because a concurrent request
  # for the same event id already published the event — so it is recorded as
  # `ignored:duplicate_delivery` and answered 200, alongside the other decisions
  # this layer already records. Parking it as `failed:` would put a row in front of
  # a human at 3am for an event that is published and correct.
  class Ingestion
    # Recorded when a delivery lost the race to publish its own event. A
    # decision, in the vocabulary `processor_webhooks.error` already uses, not a
    # failure: the event exists, written by the request that won.

        # Two deliveries of one event id both read `handled?` as false, both
        # dispatch, and one loses the insert. By the time the loser is here the
        # winner has **committed** — the constraint is what made it wait — so the
        # event is durably published and this delivery's own work rolled back with
        # its transaction.
        #
        # **Two different routes can lose this race**, which is why the rescue is
        # on the exception class and not on a particular constraint:
        #
        #   * `outbox_events_processor_event_id_idx` for the payment and the
        #     updated/deleted subscription events, whose payloads carry
        #     `processor_event_id`.
        #   * the `subscriptions` table for `customer.subscription.created`, whose
        #     `billing.subscription.started` payload **deliberately does not**
        #     carry `processor_event_id` (the lifecycle's start payload is
        #     `core_payload` plus `started_at`, and `lifecycle_test.rb` asserts the
        #     key's absence). The duplicate `INSERT` into `subscriptions` is
        #     refused before the outbox is reached.
        #
        # That second route was **measured, not assumed**, and the measurement
        # corrected an assumption worth recording: it is not one constraint. The
        # model carries a uniqueness validation on `processor_subscription_id`
        # *and* the table has a unique index over the same column, and two racing
        # threads can be refused by either. Over 60 barrelled duplicate creations
        # on this branch the split was 57 refused by the index and **3 by the
        # validation**, which is why the branch below exists and why this comment
        # does not name a single index. Dropping *every* index on `subscriptions`
        # and re-running the same two deliveries reopens it (two subscription
        # rows, two `billing.subscription.started` events), so the property does
        # rest on constraints — just on more than one, none of which is
        # individually sufficient. `concurrent_delivery_test.rb` tests both routes.
        #
        # A decision, not a failure, and the vocabulary says so: the event exists,
        # written by a request no longer in flight, and this delivery has nothing
        # left to do. Answering anything but 200 would tell the processor to
        # redeliver, and the redelivery would race again. Parking it as `failed:`
