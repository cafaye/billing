module Identity
  # The one place a caller's identity is established, and the only place a JWT is
  # read in this repository.
  #
  # ## What this is
  #
  # A verifier, not a seam. courier's `CourierWeb.Plugs.Principal` resolves a
  # caller through a configurable resolver whose default authenticates nobody,
  # because identity's JWKS machinery had not landed when it was written. That
  # decision was right for courier and it is **not** right here: billing holds
  # prices, payment records and the ability to cancel somebody's subscription, and
  # a default that authenticates nobody is a locked door — correct, but a locked
  # door nobody can open. So this service ships the real verifier, and the failure
  # direction is the one the brief asks for: **an unconfigured or unreachable
  # identity locks `/v1`, and never serves it.**
  #
  # Concretely, in the order a request meets it:
  #
  #   1. **No issuer or no audience configured** -> `Identity::Unconfigured` -> 503.
  #      A deployment that has not told this service how to verify a token has not
  #      earned the right to serve `/v1`, and the operator's first question is
  #      "what did I forget to set", which a 401 sends them away from.
  #   2. **The protected header is read before anything else.** `alg` must be
  #      RS256 and `kid` must be a non-empty string, both checked on the *token*.
  #      This runs before any network call, so a forged `alg: none` or an HS256
  #      token signed with a published public key costs identity nothing and never
  #      aims traffic at it. The algorithm is a property of the key set identity
  #      publishes, not a hint a caller supplies.
  #   3. **The key set is fetched once and cached by `kid`**, with a bounded TTL.
  #      An unknown `kid` gets **one** forced refresh per cache window: identity
  #      rotating a key is the ordinary case, and a burst of forged tokens naming
  #      keys it does not publish is the abusive one. The budget is claimed before
  #      the fetch and is spent whether the fetch succeeds or not, because a
  #      refresh that fails is precisely the situation in which an unlimited fetch
  #      allowance aimed at identity is worth having.
  #   4. **The signature, then the claims.** `iss`, `aud`, `exp` and the presence
  #      of `sub`, `iat`, `jti` and `account_id` are all required. `account_id` is
  #      what every query on `/v1` is scoped by, and a token without one cannot be
  #      scoped — see `Principal`.
  #
  # ## Why `jwt` and not OpenSSL
  #
  # Same reasoning as the `stripe` gem: this is the one place a forged amount must
  # never be believed, and a hand-rolled verifier is how `alg: none` and
  # HS256-signed-with-the-public-key get through. The gem does the signature; this
  # class does the platform's rules about *which* signatures, and nothing about
  # what the claims mean.
  #
  # ## Why the answer is not "it depends"
  #
  # Every refusal here is one of the three classes in `Identity`, and the class is
  # the whole of what a caller learns. Which of the four things was wrong with a
  # token — its signature, its expiry, its issuer, its audience — is not something
  # a caller learns by trying, so the 401 body is one fixed sentence and the
  # specific reason goes to the log with the trace id.
  class TokenVerifier
    # core allows RS256 and ES256. RS256 only, and pinned here rather than read
    # from the token: widening it is a one-line change, and doing it before
    # identity publishes ES256 keys would widen the attack surface for nothing.
    # `guard`'s verifier made the same call for the same reason.
    ALGORITHM = "RS256"

    # What identity publishes at `{issuer}/.well-known/jwks.json`. Fixed by the
    # OIDC discovery specification and by guard, which hardcodes the same path.
    JWKS_PATH = "/.well-known/jwks.json"

    # How long a fetched key set is reused before it is fetched again. Five
    # minutes, which is guard's number: long enough that the hot path makes no
    # outbound call, short enough that a rotation is picked up without a restart.
    CACHE_TTL = 5.minutes

    # One fetch's ceiling. A verifier with no timeout is a request that can hang
    # for as long as identity takes to answer, which is a way to spend this
    # process's workers without sending any traffic.
    FETCH_TIMEOUT = 5.seconds

    # core's registered claims, all of them.
    #
    # **`account_id` is deliberately NOT in this list, and the reason is which
    # message the operator gets.** The gem refuses a missing required claim with
    # `JWT::MissingRequiredClaim`, which names the claim and nothing else — and for
    # `account_id` that message is actively misleading, because the claim is not
    # missing by accident: `identity` deliberately does not issue one, and sends
    # `accounts` (an array) instead. An operator reading
    # "token refused: JWT::MissingRequiredClaim" goes looking for a malformed token
    # rather than for a cross-repository disagreement they can actually fix, which
    # is `Principal::NO_ACCOUNT`'s whole job. So the tenancy claim is enforced in
    # the one place that can explain it, and the outcome is the same refusal.
    #
    # It is enforced, not dropped. `Principal.build` requires a uuid there, and a
    # token without one is refused rather than treated as "no account", because "no
    # account" and "an account I could not read" must not both be answers to the
    # same request.
    REQUIRED_CLAIMS = %w[iss aud sub exp iat jti].freeze

    # The class-level handle, so a deployment configures one verifier and a spec
    # swaps it. Read from the environment at construction rather than memoized at
    # boot, so a rotated issuer is picked up without a redeploy — the same reason
    # `Processor::StripeClient` does it.
