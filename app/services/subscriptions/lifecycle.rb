  # Applies one verified processor event to the subscriptions table, and returns
  # the event that change produced.
  #
  # This is the **only** writer of a subscription's state and the only thing that
  # emits a subscription's events. There is no `after_update` on `Subscription` and
  # no branch of the API that changes a status: `POST /v1/subscriptions/:id/cancel`
  # asks the processor to cancel and waits for the webhook that follows, and the
  # row moves when the event arrives. One writer means there is one answer to "what
  # is this subscription's status", and it comes from the party that can bill.
  #
  # The event type is **derived from what happened to the row**, not taken from the
  # processor's event type. A deletion that arrives before its creation creates a
  # `canceled` row and is therefore a cancellation; an update that arrives first
  # would create an active row and be therefore a start. A mapping keyed on the
  # processor's type would publish `billing.subscription.updated` for a
  # subscription nobody has ever seen start.
  #
  # ## A deletion that arrives before its creation
  #
  # The one genuinely interesting case, and the reason the state machine is a table
  # rather than a `case`. A `customer.subscription.deleted` for a subscription this
  # service has never seen creates a `canceled` row rather than being dropped. It
  # is the only statement about that subscription that has arrived, and dropping it
  # would leave an active row — and active rows grant entitlements — for something
  # the processor says is gone. The `created` that follows is then refused by the
  # machine's terminal rule, so the subscription is never started and never grants
  # anything. A subscriber that was created and canceled inside one delivery window
  # ends up recorded as canceled, which is the truth.
  #
  # ## A delivery that predates the row is refused
  #
  # The terminal rule is about a *pair* of statuses, and it covers the one case
  # where this service knows the order for certain. Everything else is a
  # *sequence*: the processor does not promise delivery order, so a delivery can
  # arrive after a later one, and legality on its own would happily apply it. A
  # `past_due` subscription whose charge failed becomes `active` again, which
  # grants entitlements nobody is paying for — and a stale `cancel_at_period_end:
  # false` tells every downstream consumer a cancellation was called off.
  #
  # So the row remembers the processor's own timestamp for the delivery that last
  # wrote it, and a delivery strictly older than that is refused. `Refused` is the
  # right shape here: it is a decision this service made, the delivery row records
  # the reason, and the endpoint answers 200, because a processor that retries a
  # stale delivery reaches the identical conclusion.

      # is the envelope's subject, so a consumer joins `started`, `updated` and
      # `canceled` on one key with no lookup table.
      #
      # **core's schemas for these three types describe a different payload, and
      # this is recorded rather than matched.** core-03 rewrote
      # `schemas/events/billing/subscription/started.schema.json` (D10) on the
      # grounds that "billing has no subscriptions table and cannot invent ids it
      # does not have" — which was true of billing-03b and stopped being true when
      # this table landed. Its `started`, `updated` and `canceled` schemas are the
      # processor-normalised shape, closed with `additionalProperties: false`, so
      # the cafaye ids below are exactly the fields core refuses and the `kind`,
      # `processor`, `processor_event_id` and `customer_id` it requires are exactly
      # the ones absent here. core's own D10 anticipates this — "when billing grows
      # a subscriptions table, the shape moves again … that is a second breaking
      # change" — and that change is core's, in a repository this service may only
      # read.
      #
      # So the difference is written down in `PENDING_PAYLOAD_ALIGNMENT` in
      # `test/contract/outbox_envelope_contract_test.rb` and in `cafaye.yml`, and
      # asserted in both directions. Matching core here instead would be one of the
      # two ways this service can change a published contract without anyone
      # deciding to: emit a payload no consumer has agreed to, or drop `plan_id`
      # and `account_id`, which are the two fields that make a subscription event
      # actionable at all. When core decides, the change lands here and in the
      # contract test together — not by one quietly drifting from the other.
      #
      # The asymmetry between the three is deliberate and still holds: a start also
      # carries `started_at`, and the other two carry the period, the cancellation
      # intent, the time it took effect, and the processor's own ids, because those
