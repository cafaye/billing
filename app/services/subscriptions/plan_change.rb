  # When a plan change takes effect, and what the processor is told to do about
  # the money in between.
  #
  # **The rule: a move to a more expensive plan takes effect immediately; a move
  # to a cheaper or equal one takes effect at the end of the current period.**
  # One rule, not two, because the two directions are the same decision read from
  # opposite ends and stating them separately invites them to disagree.
  #
  # Why this way round:
  #
  #   * **An upgrade charges the difference now.** The customer asked for more
  #     service, and delivering it at the end of the period means they used it for
  #     free in between. The credit for the part of the period already paid on the
  #     old plan is the processor's to compute.
  #   * **A downgrade does not refund mid-period.** Nobody is refunded for a plan
  #     they are already leaving, and a customer who moves to a cheaper plan is not
  #     billed at the new rate for the remainder of a period they paid for at the
  #     old one. That would mean issuing a credit, and a credit this service
  #     computed would eventually disagree with the processor's own books.
  #
  # So the only thing this object does with money is compare two of them, and a
  # comparison of `Money` values is the only arithmetic in this file. There is no
  # credit, no refund, no prorated figure and no annualisation: the processor is
  # sent a *behaviour* (`always_invoice` or `none`) and computes the number.
  # Nothing here is a Float, and nothing here is persisted.
  #
  # Two comparisons are refused rather than guessed, and both refusals matter
  # because a wrong answer is a wrong amount of money:
  #
  #   * **Different currencies.** `Money#<=>` is nil across currencies, so a bare
  #     `>` would raise from inside Comparable — the right answer for the wrong
  #     reason, with a message about an operator rather than about this change.
  #     FX is a pricing decision, not something a plan change may make.
  #   * **Different intervals.** Ten dollars a month against a hundred a year is
  #     not a cheaper plan; it is a different unit. Multiplying a monthly price by
  #     twelve to compare it with an annual one is computing money that nobody
  #     asked for, in a currency of our own invention.
