# The outbox: an event, written in the same transaction as the thing it
# describes.
#
# The row is the *state change*, not the message about it. It is inserted by
# `after_create`/`after_update` — deliberately not `after_commit`, because a
# separate transaction is a window in which the database says the customer
# exists and the event does not. A rollback of the record takes the event with
# it; a commit makes both durable together. That is the whole rule, and it is
# core's: docs/event-outbox.md.
#
# The column list below is core's contract, not a local invention: `id`,
# `event_type`, `source`, `subject`, `time`, `data`, `created_at`,
# `published_at`, `attempts`. What this packet does not build is the publisher
# loop that moves rows to NATS — cafaye has no broker wired up, and adding a
# queue is a dependency decision (AGENTS.md) that this packet does not get to
# make. `published_at` and `attempts` are therefore always null and always zero,
# which is a known gap and is written down in README.md rather than hidden by
# pretending the loop exists.
#
# `event_type` rather than `type` is not cosmetic: on any Active Record model a
# column named `type` is single-table inheritance, and a row whose value is
# `billing.customer.created` would send Rails looking for a class with that name.
# It is also what core's DDL says.
