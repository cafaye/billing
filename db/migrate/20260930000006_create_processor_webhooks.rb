# Processor webhooks: a payment processor's event, as received.
#
# The table exists for one property — a replay is a non-event — and everything
# about its shape serves that. Delivery is at-least-once, so the same event id
# arrives again, immediately or a day later, and the second arrival must not
# produce a second `billing.payment.succeeded` with a second envelope id. The
# unique index on `stripe_event_id` is what turns that second arrival into a
# lookup.
#
# The payload is stored before anything tries to interpret it, and stored
# verbatim. A payload this build could not process is still the raw material for
# a replay by hand once the mapping is fixed, and a normalized hash would be the
# wrong thing to replay: it is the *processor's* bytes that the mapping is a claim
# about.
#
# `processed_at` is `timestamptz` like every other instant here, and NULL means
# "received, not finished" — the only state a crash can leave behind, and the
# one worth alerting on.
#
# `stripe_event_id` is named for the processor rather than being a
# (processor, event_id) pair. Stripe is the only processor in this build, and a
# second one gets its own column: a polymorphic pair would let one processor's
# ids be unique against its own while colliding with another's, which is a
# constraint that can be added to a table and cannot be removed from a table
# that already holds the data.
