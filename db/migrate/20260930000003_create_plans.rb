# Plans: what can be bought, at what price, on what cadence.
#
# `amount_cents` is an INTEGER of minor units. The name says cents because the
# first processor is Stripe and Stripe speaks cents; the *value* is minor units
# of `currency`, so a JPY plan stores 500 in a column called amount_cents. The
# Ruby side never touches this column as a number — `Plan#price` is a `Money`
# and it is the only way an amount enters the model (see the AGENTS.md money
# rules). Money being an integer is enforced here by the column type, by a
# CHECK, and by the model, so a value that somehow arrives as a Float or a
# negative cannot be stored.
