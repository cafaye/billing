# Customers: the billing-side record of something identity already knows about.
#
# `owner_type` + `owner_id` is a reference across a service boundary, not an
# association. identity owns `User` and `Account`; billing stores their uuids
# and deliberately declares no foreign key, because a foreign key to another
# service's table is a cross-database dependency that outlives the deployment
# that created it. The cost of that choice — a dangling reference is possible —
# is paid back by the validation that `owner_type` names an identity entity and
# `owner_id` is a uuid, and by the events a later packet will react to.
#
# A customer is billing's row, not the person. `processor_customer_id` is the
# Stripe-side id, and it is null in v0: this packet makes no Stripe call, so
# the column is reserved and honest about being empty.
