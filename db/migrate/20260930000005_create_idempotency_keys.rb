# Idempotency keys: the record that a mutating POST already happened.
#
# core's openapi-conventions.md requires that a retriable POST accept
# `Idempotency-Key`, and that a replay with the same key *and the same body*
# return the original response. That needs somewhere to keep the response,
# which is what this is.
#
# `principal` is part of the unique key because the key is scoped to
# (endpoint, principal, key) — one caller's key must not replay another
# caller's response. In v0 the endpoints are unauthenticated (see README), so
# the principal is the constant below; it becomes the token's `sub` when the
# platform's authorization packet lands, and the unique index already covers it.
#
# `request_digest` is what makes "same key, same body" decidable. Storing the
# body itself would mean holding a request payload for 24 hours to compare it;
# a digest answers the only question anyone asks.
