# gate_declaration_self_test.sh — break this repository's gate declaration on
# purpose, five times, and assert the checker goes red AND names the finding.
#
#   script/gate_declaration_self_test.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A gate that has never been observed red is not a gate, and a
# red proof nobody can reproduce is a claim rather than evidence. This repository
# has a rule about exactly this — AGENTS.md: "A tripwire that has never been
# seen red is a check that has never been tested" — and gate.yml's own header
# lists the five breakages it was written against. This script is what makes
# that list re-runnable instead of a story about a Tuesday.
#
# IT NEEDS core's checker, NOT A COPY OF IT.
#
#   $CORE_PATH, or ../core beside this worktree
#
# which is the same seam the contract tier reads, so a developer who has core
# where the suite needs it already has it here. The checker's own verdict is
# never reimplemented: this script asserts on its output, so "the gate is
# red" is a fact about core's `harness/gate_check.py` and not about a grep
# somebody wrote to agree with a hoped-for result.
#
# WHAT IT DOES TO THIS WORKTREE, AND WHY THAT IS SAFE
#
# It deletes `bin/prime`, replaces it with `exit 0`, deletes a test file, and
# edits one number in `gate.yml`. Every one of those files is copied to a
# temporary directory first and restored by a trap on EXIT, INT and TERM, so an
# interrupted run does not leave a worktree with no gate in it. The final
# control re-runs the check afterwards, which is the only thing that actually
# proves the restores worked: a script that reports five reds and leaves the
# tree broken has proved nothing about the declaration. That control compares
# against the copies taken at the start of the run, not against `HEAD`, so a
# worktree with uncommitted work in it is not mistaken for a damaged one.
#
# RUNTIME, AND WHY IT IS SLOW
#
# Measured: 181 seconds end to end on a saturated 8-core host (load average
# 83-107), of which two `--prove` runs are the whole cost. Cases 1 and 5 are
# fast because the gate they break exits in under a second, and case 4 is
# static. The cases are strictly sequential and must stay that way: they mutate
# one worktree, and two `--prove` runs in one checkout race on the same
# per-worker test databases, which is the failure mode AGENTS.md warns about
# under "One checkout, one suite." Run it when the machine has room for it.
#
# THE EXIT CODE IS THE WHOLE CONTRACT
#
#   0   every case went red, named the finding it expected, and the tree came
#       back clean.
#   1   at least one case did not. Either the gate did not notice, or it noticed
#       and said something else, or a restore failed. Both are defects and both
#       are this script's to report rather than to work around.
#
# NOTHING HERE WEAKENS AN ASSERTION, ADDS A SLEEP, OR RAISES A RETRY COUNT.
# Every case is a deletion, a substitution, a number, or a PATH. A gate that can
# only be made red by changing what the suite verifies is not being tested by
# this script; it is being rewritten by it.

# `minimum: 763` and `minimum: 764`, which is D9's defect — the same number
# written down in two files and correct in neither. It is not hypothetical: when
# billing-12 and billing-13 merged and the real floor moved to 950, this case
# raised a floor that no longer existed. The sed found its literal, edited a line
# that said `minimum: 763`, produced a gate that was still green at 950 runs, and
# **reported the case as passing** while proving nothing about floors at all.
# That is the worst version of a self-test: not a red that gets read, but a
# green that gets believed.
#
# So the case reads the current floor out of the declaration and raises *that*.
# If the declaration's shape changes and the floor cannot be found, the case
# FAILS loudly rather than silently editing nothing.
